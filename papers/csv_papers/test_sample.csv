Collection of biospecimens from the inspiration4 mission establishes the standards for the space omics and medical atlas (SOMA),papers/pdf_papers/Collection of biospecimens from the inspiration4 mission establishes the standards for the space omics and medical atlas (SOMA).pdf,Abstract,"The SpaceX Inspiration4 mission provided a unique opportunity to study the impact of 
spaceflight on the human body. Biospecimen samples were collected from four crew 
members longitudinally before (Launch: L-92, L-44, L-3 days), during (Flight Day: FD1, 
FD2, FD3), and after (Return: R + 1, R + 45, R + 82, R + 194 days) spaceflight, spanning a 
total of 289 days across 2021-2022. The collection process included venous whole blood, 
capillary dried blood spot cards, saliva, urine, stool, body swabs, capsule swabs, SpaceX 
Dragon capsule HEPA filter, and skin biopsies. Venous whole blood was further processed to 
obtain aliquots of serum, plasma, extracellular vesicles and particles, and peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells. In total, 2,911 sample aliquots were shipped to our central lab at Weill 
Cornell Medicine for downstream assays and biobanking. This paper provides an overview of 
the extensive biospecimen collection and highlights their processing procedures and long-
term biobanking techniques, facilitating future molecular tests and evaluations.As such, this 
study details a robust framework for obtaining and preserving high-quality human, microbial, 
and environmental samples for aerospace medicine in the Space Omics and Medical Atlas 
(SOMA) initiative, which can aid future human spaceflight and space biology experiments. 
 
Subject terms: Molecular biology, Genetics, Biomarkers 
Here the authors provide the biospecimen collection methodology from the SpaceX 
Inspiration4 mission, including venous blood, capillary blood, saliva, urine, stool, skin 
biopsy, body swab, and environmental swab samples","Biospecimen collection overview 
We formulated and executed a sampling plan that spans a wide range of biospecimen 
samples: venous blood, capillary dried blood spots (DBSs), saliva, urine, stool, skin swabs, 
skin biopsies, and environmental swabs (Fig. 1a). The collection of various types of samples 
covered the scope of previous assays on astronaut samples (Supplementary Table 1), but also 
enabled newer omics technologies, such as spatially resolved, single-molecule, and single-
cell assays.

a List of biospecimen samples collected over the course of the study. b Timepoints for each 
biospecimen sample collection. “L-” denotes the number of days prior to launch. “R + ” 
denotes the number of days after return to Earth. “FD” denotes which day of the flight a 
sample was collected. c Location of each collection timepoint. 
For the I4 mission, sample collection spanned three-time points pre-launch (L-92, L-44, L-3 
days), three-time points during flight (Flight Day 1 (FD1), FD2, FD3), and four-time points 
post-return (R + 1, R + 45, R + 82, R + 194 days). Venous blood, urine, stool, and skin 
biopsies were collected during ground timepoints only, while capillary DBSs, saliva, and skin 
swabs were collected both on the ground and during flight (Fig. 1b). Environmental swabs of 
the Dragon capsule were collected pre-flight in the crew training capsule and during flight in 
the spacecraft launched from Cape Canaveral (Fig. 1b). 
Samples were collected across a variety of locations based on the crew’s training and travel 
schedule. L-92 and L-44 were collected in Hawthorne, CA at SpaceX Headquarters, L-3 and 
R + 1 were collected at Cape Canaveral, FL at a facility near the launch site. FD1, FD2, and 
FD3 were collected inside the Dragon capsule while in orbit. R + 45 was collected at the crew 

members’ individual locations (which spanned the US States NY, NJ, TN, and WA), R + 82 
was collected at Weill Cornell Medicine, NY and R + 194 was collected at Baylor College of 
Medicine, TX (Fig. 1c). All samples from ground timepoints were processed within 16 hours 
of collection. All samples from the flight were processed immediately after retrieval from the 
flight. 
Samples were stored at −80 °C at each site immediately after processing and aliquoting 
(processing steps are outlined below). All samples were shipped via FedEx using Overnight 
Shipping to Weill Cornell Medicine for storage in the Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank 
(CAMbank) within 1 week of collection on dry ice in styrofoam boxes and spent <2 days in 
transit. No samples were shipped on a Thursday or Friday to avoid weekend shipping delays. 
All samples arrived at Weill Cornell Medicine with dry-ice still in the packaging and samples 
frozen. Samples were immediately transferred to −80 °C for long-term storage and 
biobanking. Any exceptions to this process will be noted below. In total, we collected 2,911 
sample aliquots, which were then processed in our central lab at Weill Cornell Medicine for 
downstream assays (Supplementary Table 2). Some samples were processed immediately at 
field laboratory facilities (Supplementary Data Fig. 1). DNA and RNA yields are also 
reported below from collection kits (saliva and stool) after arrival at WCM. 
Blood collection and derivatives 
Blood was collected using a combination of venipuncture tubes to collect venous blood and 
contact-activated lancets to collect capillary blood from the fingertip. Each crew member 
provided blood samples, collected into one BD PAXgene blood RNA tube (bRNA), four BD 
Vacutainer K2 EDTA tubes, two BD Vacutainer cell preparation tubes (CPTs), one Streck 
cell-free DNA tube (cfDNA BCT), one BD Vacutainer serum separator tube (SST), and one 
DBS card per time point. Tubes were transported from the collection site to the field 
laboratory at room temperature. From these tubes, whole blood, plasma, PBMCs, serum, and 
cell pellet samples were collected (Supplementary Table 3). Sample yields are reported 
below. Samples were aliquoted for long-term storage and biobanking (Supplementary 
Table 4). 
bRNA tubes were collected in order to isolate total RNA using the PAXgene blood RNA kit 
(Fig. 2a). Yield ranged from 3.04 to 14.04 µg/tube of total RNA across all samples, and the 
RNA integrity number (RIN) ranged from 3.2 to 8.5 (mean: 6.95) (Fig. 2b). RNA was stored 
at −80 °C after extraction. The collection of total RNA enables a variety of downstream RNA 
profiling methods. It will allow comparative studies to prior RNA-sequencing performed on 
astronauts, particularly snoRNA & lncRNA biomarkers analyzed from Space Shuttle era 
blood25,26, mRNA & miRNA measured during the NASA Twin Study17,18, and whole blood 
RNA arrays from the ISS27,28. Additionally, RNA yields are more than sufficient to perform 
direct-RNA sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platforms, which 
require 500 ng of total RNA per library (Manufacturer’s protocol, ONT kit SQK-RNA002). 
This enables the study of RNA modification changes during spaceflight to create 
epitranscriptomic profiles for the first time in astronauts.

“[2] EVPS” tube on Fig. 2c. e PBMC yields per mL from the “[3] PBMCs” tubes on Fig. 2c. 
Four K2 EDTA tubes were drawn at each timepoint from each crew member (Fig. 2c). One 
K2 EDTA tube was submitted to Quest Diagnostics to perform a complete blood count 
(CBC, Quest Test Code: 6399). One tube was used to isolate extracellular vesicles and 
particles (EVPs) for proteomic quantification (Fig. 3a). Total EVP quantities varied from 
2.71-28.27 ug (Fig. 2d). Two K2 EDTA tubes were used to isolate PBMCs for single-cell 
sequencing (10X Chromium Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression and Chromium 
Single Cell Immune Profiling workflows). After collection, a Ficoll separation was 
performed to isolate PBMCs, which ranged from 340,000-975,000 cells per mL of blood 
(Fig. 2e). One prior single-cell gene expression experiment, NASA Twin study, was 
performed on astronauts, which found immune cell population specific gene expression 
changes and a correlation with microRNA signatures11,18.

Additional PBMCs, plasma, and serum were collected from CPTs (Fig. 4a), cfDNA BCTs 
(Fig. 4d), SSTs (Fig. 4c), as well as red blood cell pellets. CPTs were spun and aliquoted 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Fig. 3b). Plasma volume per tube ranged from 
3000-14,000 uL per tube (Fig. 4d). Because of technical issues in the sample processing 
procedure, three instances occurred where plasma retrieval from the CPT tubes was not 
possible. Plasma can be used to validate or refute previous studies, including cytokine 
panel10,29, exosomal RNA-seq25,26, extracellular vesicle microRNA30, and proteomic20,31–

nitrogen after slowly cooled in a Mr. Frosty to -80 °C. These can be used to follow-up on 
previous studies on adaptive immunity, cell function, and immune dysregulation8,34–39. The 
remaining red blood cell pellet mixtures from below the gel plug in each CPT Tube were 
stored at −20 °C.

a A spun CPT yields plasma, PBMCs, and a red blood cell pellet. PBMC from each tube 
were divided into 6 cryovials and viably frozen. Plasma was aliquoted and the pellet was 
frozen at −20C. b A spun cfDNA BCT yields plasma and a red blood cell pellet. Plasma was 
purified with an additional spin (see Fig. 4a) then aliquoted. The pellet was frozen at 
−20C. c A spun SST yields serum and a red blood cell pellet. Serum was aliquoted and the 
pellet was frozen at −20C. d CPT plasma volumes per timepoint are reported. e cfDNA 
(Streck) BCT plasma volumes per timepoint. fSST serum volumes per timepoint. An extra 
tube was drawn for C004 at R + 45, resulting in a higher serum yield. 
cfDNA BCT (Streck) tubes were collected to isolate high-quality cfDNA from plasma. 
cfDNA BCTs were spun and aliquoted according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Fig. 3c). 
The remaining cell pellet mixture was frozen at −20 °C. Plasma volume per timepoint ranged 
from 1500-5000 uL (Fig. 4e). 500 uL aliquots were frozen at -80 °C. cfDNA extracted from 
these tubes can be analyzed for fragment length, mitochondrial or nuclear origin, and cell 
type or tissue of origin40–42. 

The SST was spun and aliquoted according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Fig. 3d). 
Serum volume ranged from 2000-8000 uL per timepoint (Fig. 4f). Similar to plasma, serum 
can be allocated for cytokine analysis and can also be used to perform comprehensive 
metabolic panels, including one we used at Quest (CMP, Quest Test Code: 10231) for metrics 
on alkaline phosphatase, calcium, glucose, potassium, and sodium, among other metabolic 
markers. The remaining cell pellet mixture from each SST tube was stored at −20 °C. 
In addition to venous blood, capillary blood was collected onto a DBS card using a contact-
activated lancet pressed against the fingertip (Fig. 5a). Capillary blood was collected onto a 
Whatman 903 Protein Saver DBS card to preserve nucleic acids and proteins. Each of the five 
spots on the DBS card hold 75-80uL of capillary blood, however, the amount of capillary 
blood collected across timepoints varied (Fig. 5b, c) according to how much blood could be 
collected before the lancet-puncture closed. 
Fig. 5. Dried Blood Spot (DBS) Collection Yields. 
 
Open in a new tab 
a DBS cards were collected preflight, during flight, and postflight. There were five spots for 
blood collection per card. b Blood collections varied in saturation level across blood spots 
and timepoints. These were classified as “full”, “partial”, and occasionally “empty”. c DBS 
card yields per blood spot, per timepoint, and per crew member. 
Saliva collection 
Saliva was collected at the L-92, L-44, L-3, FD1, FD2, FD3, R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 
timepoints using two methods. First, saliva was collected using the OMNIgene Oral Kit 

(OME-505), which preserves nucleic acids (Fig. 6a) during the ground timepoints. From 
these samples, DNA, RNA, and protein were extracted. DNA yield ranged from 28.1 to 
3187.8 ng, RNA yield from 396.0 to 3544.2 ng (less the two samples had concentrations too 
low for measurement), and protein concentration from 92.97 to 93.15 ng.

collected per timepoint. 
Second, crude saliva (i.e., saliva with no preservative added) was collected into a 5 mL 
DNase/RNase-free screw top tube during the ground and flight timepoints. Saliva volume 
varied from 150 to 4000 uL per tube (Fig. 6b). Crude saliva was also collected during flight 
(FD2 and FD3), in addition to the ground timepoints. 
Saliva collections have been conducted throughout spaceflight studies for assessing the 
immune state of crews, particularly in the context of viral reactivation. Previously identified 
viruses that reactivate during spaceflight include Epstein–Barr, varicella-zoster, and 
cytomegalovirus43. Responses to reactivation of these viruses can be asymptomatic, 
debilitating, or even life-threatening, thus assessing these adaptations is beneficial in 
understanding viral spaceflight activity as well as crew health. In addition to viral nucleic 
acid quantification, numerous biochemical assays can also be performed, including 

measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and 
cytokines, among others10,43–46. 
Urine collection 
Urine was collected in sterile specimen cups at the L-92, L-44, L-3, R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 
timepoints. Specimen cups were collected 1-2 times per day. For preservation, urine was 
aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Half the urine had Zymo Urine Conditioning Buffer (UCB) 
added before freezing, to preserve nucleic acids. Samples yielded 23–155.5 mL of crude urine 
and 21 - 112 mL of UCB urine per specimen cup (Fig. 7a). Urine was split into 1 mL - 15 mL 
aliquots before freezing at -80 °C.

status54–56, kidney stones54,55, proteomics11, telomere measurements57, and various biomarkers 
and metabolites17,49,58–61. 
Stool collection 

Stool was collected at the L-92, L-44, R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 timepoints. Stool samples 
were stored into two collection containers at each timepoint, one DNA Genotek OMNIgene 
Gut (OMR−200) kit with a preservative for metagenomics and another (ME−200) with a 
preservative for metabolomics (Fig. 7b). Stool was the least consistent sample collected due 
to the limited windows available for sampling during collection timeframes. DNA and RNA 
were extracted from aliquots of the OMNIgene Gut (OMR−200) tubes for downstream 
microbiome analysis. DNA yield ranged from 358.5 to 16,660 ng, RNA from 690 to 2010 ng 
(Fig. 7c). Large variations in yield are attributable to variable stool mass collected between 
kits. 
Stool samples enable various biochemical, immune, and microbiome changes studies. 
Previous metagenomic assays have found that shannon alpha diversity and richness during 
long-duration missions to the ISS62. 
Skin swabs 
Body swabs were collected at all timepoints. Samples were collected by swabbing the body 
region of interest for 30 seconds, then placing the swab in a sterile 2D matrix tube (Thermo 
Scientific #3710) with Zymo DNA/RNA shield preservative. For the first two swab locations, 
the oral and nasal cavity, the swab was placed directly on the body after removal from its 
sterile packaging (dry-swab method; Fig. 8a). For the remaining body locations, the swab was 
briefly dipped in nuclease-free, DNA/RNA-free water before proceeding (wet-swab method). 
Eight distinct sites were swabbed with the wet-swab method: post-auricular, axillary vault, 
volar forearm, occiput, umbilicus, gluteal crease, glabella, and the toe-web space (Fig. 8b). 
The astronaut microbiome has previously been studied in the forehead, forearm, nasal, 
armpit, navel, postauricular, and tongue body locations, and changes have been documented 
during flight. Changes in alpha diversity and beta diversity were documented, as well as 
shifts in microbial genera62. However, the impact of these changes on skin health and 
immunological health are not well understood. 
Fig. 8. Skin Collection Locations and Sample Types. 

 
Open in a new tab 
a Dry swabs were collected from two body locations. b Wet swabs were collected from eight 
body locations. c Swabs were collected from the deltoid region. Immediately after, 3- or 4-
mm skin biopsies were collected from the same area and divided for histology and spatially 
resolved transcriptomics. 
Acquiring extensive swab samples from the crew skin allows for characterization of the 
habitat environment, crew skin microbiome adaptations, and interactions with potential 
human health adaptations resulting from spaceflight exposure. This is very relevant for crew 
health, considering astronauts become more susceptible to infections during spaceflight 
missions63, with the relationship between microbe-host interactions from spaceflight 
exposure, which may be a causative factor of astronauts immune dysfunction, which is still 
not well understood. 
Skin Biopsies 
A skin biopsy on the deltoid was obtained from the L-44 and R + 1 timepoint. Biopsies were 
also collected in advance of a flight to ensure the biopsy site is fully healed before the flight 
so there is no risk of complication. The wet-swab method was used to collect the skin 
microbiome before the skin biopsy. The skin biopsies were 3–4 millimeters in diameter and 
were collected for histology and spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) (Fig. 8c). One-third 
of the sample was stored in formalin and kept at room temperature to perform histology. The 
remaining two-thirds of the sample was stored in a cryovial and placed at -80 °C for SRT 
(Fig. 8c). This is the first sample collected from astronauts for spatially resolved 
transcriptomics. The skin is of high interest due to the inflammation-related cytokine markers 
such as IL-12p40, IL-10, IL-17A, and IL-1810,17 and skin rash’s status as the most frequent 
clinical symptom reported during spaceflight64. 

Environmental swabs and HEPA filter 
Environmental swabs were collected in flight during the F1 and F2 timepoint. Additionally, 
environmental swabs were collected from the flight simulation capsule at SpaceX 
headquarters after days of crew training during the L-92 and L-44 timepoints. Environmental 
swabs were collected using the wet-swab method. Ten environmental swabs were collected 
per time point at the following locations in the capsule: an ambient air/control swab, the 
execute button, the viewing dome, the side hatch mobility aid, the lid of the waste locker, the 
head section of one of the seats, the commode panel, the right and left sides of the control 
screen, and the g-meter button (Fig. 9a-d). Additionally, the spacecraft’s high-efficiency 
particulate absorbing (HEPA) filter was acquired post-flight. This filter was cut into 127 
rectangular pieces (1.2” x 1.6” x 4”) and stored at −20 °C.

Previous microbial profiling of spacecraft environments has revealed that equipment 
sterilized on the ground becomes coated in microbial life in space due to interactions with 
crew and the introduction of equipment that has not undergone sterilization65. Subsequent 
microbial monitoring assays performed on the ISS have detected novel, spaceflight-specific 
species on the ISS66. Once in space, surface microbes are subject to the unique microgravity 
and radiation environment of flight, which will influence evolutionary trajectory. The 
potential impact of this influence on pathogenesis is a concern for long-duration space 
missions, especially given that changes in host-pathogen interactions may also be affected 
during spaceflight67.","Standardizing biospecimen collections across multiple missions will create 
larger sample sets needed to draw these conclusions. 

Here, we establish the standard biospecimen sample collection and banking procedures for 
the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA). A key goal of SOMA is to standardize 
biospecimen collection and processing for spaceflight, to generate high-quality multi-omics 
data across spaceflight investigations, and to enable follow-up experiments with viably frozen 
cells and biobanked samples. This paper provides sample collection methods built for 
standardized field collections across different crews and missions. We cover the decentralized 
sample collection process from the Inspiration4 (I4) mission from the point of collection to 
the preservation of samples for downstream biochemical and omics processing at our 
centralized lab at Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM). These protocols can produce synchronized 
datasets with enhanced statistical strength, amplifying our scientific findings from spaceflight 
studies. Additionally, we showcase metrics related to sample collection outputs, references of 
past astronaut sample collections in scientific publications, and suggestions to refine sample 
collection for upcoming missions. In its inaugural use case, these samples were collected 
from the I4 astronaut cohort and are currently in use for several other missions (Polaris 
Dawn, Axiom-2), which will enable continued utilization for future crewed space missions. 
 
Results 
 
Biospecimen collection overview 
We formulated and executed a sampling plan that spans a wide range of biospecimen 
samples: venous blood, capillary dried blood spots (DBSs), saliva, urine, stool, skin swabs, 
skin biopsies, and environmental swabs (Fig. 1a). The collection of various types of samples 
covered the scope of previous assays on astronaut samples (Supplementary Table 1), but also 
enabled newer omics technologies, such as spatially resolved, single-molecule, and single-
cell assays.

biospecimen sample collection. “L-” denotes the number of days prior to launch. “R + ” 
denotes the number of days after return to Earth. “FD” denotes which day of the flight a 
sample was collected. c Location of each collection timepoint. 
For the I4 mission, sample collection spanned three-time points pre-launch (L-92, L-44, L-3 
days), three-time points during flight (Flight Day 1 (FD1), FD2, FD3), and four-time points 
post-return (R + 1, R + 45, R + 82, R + 194 days). Venous blood, urine, stool, and skin 
biopsies were collected during ground timepoints only, while capillary DBSs, saliva, and skin 
swabs were collected both on the ground and during flight (Fig. 1b). Environmental swabs of 
the Dragon capsule were collected pre-flight in the crew training capsule and during flight in 
the spacecraft launched from Cape Canaveral (Fig. 1b). 
Samples were collected across a variety of locations based on the crew’s training and travel 
schedule. L-92 and L-44 were collected in Hawthorne, CA at SpaceX Headquarters, L-3 and 
R + 1 were collected at Cape Canaveral, FL at a facility near the launch site. FD1, FD2, and 
FD3 were collected inside the Dragon capsule while in orbit. R + 45 was collected at the crew 

members’ individual locations (which spanned the US States NY, NJ, TN, and WA), R + 82 
was collected at Weill Cornell Medicine, NY and R + 194 was collected at Baylor College of 
Medicine, TX (Fig. 1c). All samples from ground timepoints were processed within 16 hours 
of collection. All samples from the flight were processed immediately after retrieval from the 
flight. 
Samples were stored at −80 °C at each site immediately after processing and aliquoting 
(processing steps are outlined below). All samples were shipped via FedEx using Overnight 
Shipping to Weill Cornell Medicine for storage in the Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank 
(CAMbank) within 1 week of collection on dry ice in styrofoam boxes and spent <2 days in 
transit. No samples were shipped on a Thursday or Friday to avoid weekend shipping delays. 
All samples arrived at Weill Cornell Medicine with dry-ice still in the packaging and samples 
frozen. Samples were immediately transferred to −80 °C for long-term storage and 
biobanking. Any exceptions to this process will be noted below. In total, we collected 2,911 
sample aliquots, which were then processed in our central lab at Weill Cornell Medicine for 
downstream assays (Supplementary Table 2). Some samples were processed immediately at 
field laboratory facilities (Supplementary Data Fig. 1). DNA and RNA yields are also 
reported below from collection kits (saliva and stool) after arrival at WCM. 
Blood collection and derivatives 
Blood was collected using a combination of venipuncture tubes to collect venous blood and 
contact-activated lancets to collect capillary blood from the fingertip. Each crew member 
provided blood samples, collected into one BD PAXgene blood RNA tube (bRNA), four BD 
Vacutainer K2 EDTA tubes, two BD Vacutainer cell preparation tubes (CPTs), one Streck 
cell-free DNA tube (cfDNA BCT), one BD Vacutainer serum separator tube (SST), and one 
DBS card per time point. Tubes were transported from the collection site to the field 
laboratory at room temperature. From these tubes, whole blood, plasma, PBMCs, serum, and 
cell pellet samples were collected (Supplementary Table 3). Sample yields are reported 
below. Samples were aliquoted for long-term storage and biobanking (Supplementary 
Table 4). 
bRNA tubes were collected in order to isolate total RNA using the PAXgene blood RNA kit 
(Fig. 2a). Yield ranged from 3.04 to 14.04 µg/tube of total RNA across all samples, and the 
RNA integrity number (RIN) ranged from 3.2 to 8.5 (mean: 6.95) (Fig. 2b). RNA was stored 
at −80 °C after extraction. The collection of total RNA enables a variety of downstream RNA 
profiling methods. It will allow comparative studies to prior RNA-sequencing performed on 
astronauts, particularly snoRNA & lncRNA biomarkers analyzed from Space Shuttle era 
blood25,26, mRNA & miRNA measured during the NASA Twin Study17,18, and whole blood 
RNA arrays from the ISS27,28. Additionally, RNA yields are more than sufficient to perform 
direct-RNA sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platforms, which 
require 500 ng of total RNA per library (Manufacturer’s protocol, ONT kit SQK-RNA002). 
This enables the study of RNA modification changes during spaceflight to create 
epitranscriptomic profiles for the first time in astronauts.

Four K2 EDTA tubes were drawn at each timepoint from each crew member (Fig. 2c). One 
K2 EDTA tube was submitted to Quest Diagnostics to perform a complete blood count 
(CBC, Quest Test Code: 6399). One tube was used to isolate extracellular vesicles and 
particles (EVPs) for proteomic quantification (Fig. 3a). Total EVP quantities varied from 
2.71-28.27 ug (Fig. 2d). Two K2 EDTA tubes were used to isolate PBMCs for single-cell 
sequencing (10X Chromium Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression and Chromium 
Single Cell Immune Profiling workflows). After collection, a Ficoll separation was 
performed to isolate PBMCs, which ranged from 340,000-975,000 cells per mL of blood 
(Fig. 2e). One prior single-cell gene expression experiment, NASA Twin study, was 
performed on astronauts, which found immune cell population specific gene expression 
changes and a correlation with microRNA signatures11,18.

Additional PBMCs, plasma, and serum were collected from CPTs (Fig. 4a), cfDNA BCTs 
(Fig. 4d), SSTs (Fig. 4c), as well as red blood cell pellets. CPTs were spun and aliquoted 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Fig. 3b). Plasma volume per tube ranged from 
3000-14,000 uL per tube (Fig. 4d). Because of technical issues in the sample processing 
procedure, three instances occurred where plasma retrieval from the CPT tubes was not 
possible. Plasma can be used to validate or refute previous studies, including cytokine 
panel10,29, exosomal RNA-seq25,26, extracellular vesicle microRNA30, and proteomic20,31–
33results. PBMCs were also collected, aliquoted into 6 cryovials per CPT, and stored in liquid 
nitrogen after slowly cooled in a Mr. Frosty to -80 °C. These can be used to follow-up on 
previous studies on adaptive immunity, cell function, and immune dysregulation8,34–39. The 
remaining red blood cell pellet mixtures from below the gel plug in each CPT Tube were 
stored at −20 °C.

cfDNA BCT (Streck) tubes were collected to isolate high-quality cfDNA from plasma. 
cfDNA BCTs were spun and aliquoted according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Fig. 3c). 
The remaining cell pellet mixture was frozen at −20 °C. Plasma volume per timepoint ranged 
from 1500-5000 uL (Fig. 4e). 500 uL aliquots were frozen at -80 °C. cfDNA extracted from 
these tubes can be analyzed for fragment length, mitochondrial or nuclear origin, and cell 
type or tissue of origin40–42. 

The SST was spun and aliquoted according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Fig. 3d). 
Serum volume ranged from 2000-8000 uL per timepoint (Fig. 4f). Similar to plasma, serum 
can be allocated for cytokine analysis and can also be used to perform comprehensive 
metabolic panels, including one we used at Quest (CMP, Quest Test Code: 10231) for metrics 
on alkaline phosphatase, calcium, glucose, potassium, and sodium, among other metabolic 
markers. The remaining cell pellet mixture from each SST tube was stored at −20 °C. 
In addition to venous blood, capillary blood was collected onto a DBS card using a contact-
activated lancet pressed against the fingertip (Fig. 5a). Capillary blood was collected onto a 
Whatman 903 Protein Saver DBS card to preserve nucleic acids and proteins. Each of the five 
spots on the DBS card hold 75-80uL of capillary blood, however, the amount of capillary 
blood collected across timepoints varied (Fig. 5b, c) according to how much blood could be 
collected before the lancet-puncture closed.

a DBS cards were collected preflight, during flight, and postflight. There were five spots for 
blood collection per card. b Blood collections varied in saturation level across blood spots 
and timepoints. These were classified as “full”, “partial”, and occasionally “empty”. c DBS 
card yields per blood spot, per timepoint, and per crew member. 
Saliva collection 
Saliva was collected at the L-92, L-44, L-3, FD1, FD2, FD3, R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 
timepoints using two methods. First, saliva was collected using the OMNIgene Oral Kit 

(OME-505), which preserves nucleic acids (Fig. 6a) during the ground timepoints. From 
these samples, DNA, RNA, and protein were extracted. DNA yield ranged from 28.1 to 
3187.8 ng, RNA yield from 396.0 to 3544.2 ng (less the two samples had concentrations too 
low for measurement), and protein concentration from 92.97 to 93.15 ng.

Second, crude saliva (i.e., saliva with no preservative added) was collected into a 5 mL 
DNase/RNase-free screw top tube during the ground and flight timepoints. Saliva volume 
varied from 150 to 4000 uL per tube (Fig. 6b). Crude saliva was also collected during flight 
(FD2 and FD3), in addition to the ground timepoints. 
Saliva collections have been conducted throughout spaceflight studies for assessing the 
immune state of crews, particularly in the context of viral reactivation. Previously identified 
viruses that reactivate during spaceflight include Epstein–Barr, varicella-zoster, and 
cytomegalovirus43. Responses to reactivation of these viruses can be asymptomatic, 
debilitating, or even life-threatening, thus assessing these adaptations is beneficial in 
understanding viral spaceflight activity as well as crew health. In addition to viral nucleic 
acid quantification, numerous biochemical assays can also be performed, including 

measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and 
cytokines, among others10,43–46.

timepoints. Specimen cups were collected 1-2 times per day. For preservation, urine was 
aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Half the urine had Zymo Urine Conditioning Buffer (UCB) 
added before freezing, to preserve nucleic acids. Samples yielded 23–155.5 mL of crude urine 
and 21 - 112 mL of UCB urine per specimen cup (Fig. 7a). Urine was split into 1 mL - 15 mL 
aliquots before freezing at -80 °C.

Stool collection 

Stool was collected at the L-92, L-44, R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 timepoints. Stool samples 
were stored into two collection containers at each timepoint, one DNA Genotek OMNIgene 
Gut (OMR−200) kit with a preservative for metagenomics and another (ME−200) with a 
preservative for metabolomics (Fig. 7b). Stool was the least consistent sample collected due 
to the limited windows available for sampling during collection timeframes. DNA and RNA 
were extracted from aliquots of the OMNIgene Gut (OMR−200) tubes for downstream 
microbiome analysis. DNA yield ranged from 358.5 to 16,660 ng, RNA from 690 to 2010 ng 
(Fig. 7c). Large variations in yield are attributable to variable stool mass collected between 
kits.

Discussion 
We report here on biospecimen samples collected from the SpaceX I4 Mission, the most 
comprehensive human biological specimen collection effort performed on an astronaut cohort 
to date. The extensive archive of biospecimens included venous blood, dried blood spot 
cards, saliva, urine, stool, microbiome body swabs, skin biopsies, and environmental capsule 
swabs. The study objective was to establish a foundational set of methods for biospecimen 
collection and banking on commercial spaceflight missions suitable for multi-omic and 
molecular analysis. Biospecimens were collected to enable comprehensive, multi-omic 
profiles, which can then be used to develop molecular catalogs with higher resolution of 
human responses to spaceflight. Select, targeted measures in clinical labs (CLIA) were also 
performed immediately after sample collection (CBC, CMP), and samples and viable cells 
were preserved in a long-term Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank, such that additional 
assays and measures can be conducted in the future. 
Great care was put into the standardization of sample processing between field laboratories in 
Hawthorne, Cape Canaveral, and Houston. Despite our best efforts to control for all 
preanalytical variables68, there are some inconsistencies in sample processing that were 
unavoidable during this mission. Of note, there was no access to cold stowage during flight, 
causing all samples to be stowed at room temperature until they arrived back on Earth. Of the 
three sample types collected during flight, two were stable at room temperature (skin/capsule 
swabs stored in DNA/RNA shield and capillary blood collected on dried blood spot cards). 
The third (saliva samples), were not stored in a preservative and, for this reason, will have a 
distinct profile compared to other timepoints. This limits the context in which these samples 
will be useful, but will still provide biological insights in more targeted biological studies. 
We can imagine situations in the future where there will be tradeoffs between standardization 
of sample collection with previous missions and mission-specific constraints influencing the 
selection of biospecimen collection methods. 
However, there are several reasons why rigorous biospecimen collection methods for 
commercial and private spaceflight missions must be developed, which are scalable and 
translational across populations, missions, and mission parameters. First, little is known about 

the biological and clinical responses that occur in civilians during and after space travel. 
While professional astronauts are generally young, healthy, and extensively trained, civilian 
astronauts have been, and likely will be, far more heterogeneous. They will possess a variety 
of phenotypes, including older ages, different health backgrounds, and greater medication 
use, and may experience different medical conditions, risks, and comorbidities. Careful 
molecular characterization will be beneficial for the development of appropriate baseline 
metrics and countermeasures and, therefore, beneficial for the individual spaceflight 
experience. In the future, such analyses may enable precision medicine applications aimed at 
optimizing countermeasures for each individual astronaut who enters and returns safely from 
space69,70. 
Second, multi-omic studies inherently present a large number of measurements within a small 
set of subjects. These high-dimensional datasets present numerous potential challenges with 
regard to the amplification of noise, risk of overfitting, and false discoveries71. At all times, 
scientists engaged in multi-omic analyses must take special care that true biological variance 
is what has been measured. The introduction of experimental variance through the 
progression from sample collection, transport, and storage, to sequencing and analysis can 
introduce artifacts of variance that render the detection of true biological variance and 
interpretation of results more difficult. For this reason, tight adherence to experimental 
controls or annotation at every step of the experimental condition is crucial. Careful 
annotation allows for the assignment of class variables in post hoc analysis. Among such 
applications are the attempt to detect batch effects or determine the impact of variations in 
temperature (collection, storage, or transport)72. 
The necessary means to address experimental variance are longitudinal sampling and 
specimen aliquoting. Longitudinal sampling (i.e. collecting numerous serial samples from 
each test condition) from pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight allows for greater statistical 
power when assessing changes attributable to spaceflight. In addition, each sample collected 
should be divided upon collection into multiple aliquots. This better assures that freeze-thaw 
cycles can be avoided in the analysis stage, as freeze-thaw events can introduce considerable 
experimental variance depending on the molecular class being measured. Maintaining all 
samples at their optimal storage temperature at all times, typically -80 °C or lower (e.g. liquid 
nitrogen for cells), is crucial73. Special attention must be given to how the collection and 
storage methods in-flight vary in relation to the conditions on Earth. Spaceflight presents 
considerable differences in the operating environment, where ground conditions are far easier 
to control than flight. In practice, this may limit the types of samples that can be collected 
during flight. 
Third, rigorous methods must be developed and followed to pursue comparisons across 
missions with varying design parameters. In this consideration, there is an argument for the 
development of specimen collection, transport, storage, processing, analysis, and reporting 
standards. At the same time, this must be balanced with the flexibility required for innovation 
since standards can sometimes limit advancement in methodology. In the present study, 
common methods were used for the I4 and the Polaris Dawn and Axiom-2 missions. 
However, selected methods may require optimization for Polaris Dawn-like missions, to 
increase the yields during sample processing and adapt to unique parameters imposed by the 
anticipated spacewalk (extravehicular activity; EVA). Moreover, within standards or best 
practices, unique research for each mission may require alteration of previously successful 

methods. With these considerations in mind, we must balance methodology standardization 
with advances in methodology options and mission-specific objectives. 
As the commercial spaceflight sector gains momentum and more astronauts with different 
health profiles and backgrounds have access to space, comprehensive data on the biological 
impact of short-duration spaceflight is of paramount importance. Such data will further 
expand our understanding and knowledge of how spaceflight affects human physiology, 
microbial adaptations, and environmental biology. The use of integrative omics technologies 
for civilian astronauts has revealed novel responses across genomics, proteomics, 
metabolomics, microbiome, and transcriptomics measures74–83. Creating multi-omic datasets 
from spaceflight studies on astronaut cohorts will further advance our understanding, inform 
future mission planning, and help discover what appropriate countermeasures can be 
developed to minimize future risk and enhance performance. 
Validating sample collection methodologies initially in short-duration commercial spaceflight 
is a key step for future human health research in long-duration and exploration-class missions 
to the Moon and beyond. To help meet these challenges, we have established the SOMA 
protocols, which detail standard multi-omic measures of astronaut health and protocols for 
sample collection from astronaut cohorts. Although the all-civilian I4 crew pioneered the first 
use of the SOMA protocols, the methodology outlined here is robust and generalizable, 
making it applicable to future astronaut crews from any commercial mission provider (e.g., 
SpaceX, Axiom Space, Sierra Space, Blue Origin) or space agencies (NASA, ESA, JAXA, 
ROSCOSMOS). Furthermore, the SOMA banking, sequencing, and processing methods are a 
springboard for continuing biospecimen analysis and expanding our knowledge of multi-omic 
dynamics before, during, and after human spaceflight missions, providing a molecular 
roadmap for crew health, medical biometrics, and possible countermeasures. 
Methods 
Venous blood draw 
Venipuncture was performed on each subject using a BD Vacutainer® Safety-Lok™ blood 
collection set (BD Biosciences, #367281) and a Vacutainer one-use holder (BD Biosciences, 
364815). The puncture site was located near the cubital fossa and was sterilized with a BZK 
antiseptic towelette (Dynarex, Reorder No. 1303). Blood was collected into 1 serum separator 
tube (SST, BD Biosciences: #367987, Lot: #1158449, #1034773), 2 cell processing tubes 
(CPT, BD Biosciences: #362753, Lot: #1133477, #1012161), 1 blood RNA tube (bRNA, 
PAXgene: #762165, Lot: #1021333), 1 cell-free DNA BCT (cfDNA BCT, Streck: #230470, 
Lot: #11530331), and 4 K2 EDTA blood collection tubes (BD Biosciences, #367844, Lot: 
#0345756) per crew member per time point. For samples collected in Hawthorne, blood was 
drawn at SpaceX headquarters, then immediately transported to USC for processing. Samples 
collected at Cape Canaveral were processed on-site. 
Blood tube processing 
For processing, serum separator tubes (SST) were centrifuged at 1300x g for 10 minutes. 
500uL aliquots of serum were aliquoted into 1 mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes (ThermoFisher, 
3741-WP1D-BR) and stored at -80 °C. SST tubes were recapped and stored at −20 °C to 
preserve the red blood cell pellet. 

Cell processing tubes were centrifuged at 1800xg for 30 minutes. Plasma was aliquoted into 
1 mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes and stored at -80 °C. 5 mL of 2% FBS (ThermoFisher, 
#26140079) in PBS (ThermoFisher, #10010023) was added to the CPT tube to resuspend 
PBMCs. PBMC suspension was transferred to a clean 15 mL conical tube. The total volume 
was brought to 15 mL with 2% FBS in PBS. The tube was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 
300x g. Supernatant was discarded. PBMCs were resuspended 6 mL of 10% DMSO 
(Millipore Sigma, #D4540-500mL) in FBS. 1 mL of PBMCs were moved to 6 cryogenic 
vials (Corning, #8672). Cryovials were placed in a Mr. FrostyTM (ThermoFisher, #5100-0001) 
and stored at -80 °C. CPTs were recapped and stored at −20 °C to preserve the red blood cell 
pellet. There was one outlier to this sample collection, the R + 194 timepoint, where CPT 
sodium citrate tubes were used (BD Biosciences, Cat no. 362760). 
cfDNA BCTs were centrifuged at 300xg for 20 minutes. Plasma was transferred to a 15 mL 
conical tube. Plasma was centrifuged 5000xg for 10 minutes. 500uL aliquots of plasma were 
aliquoted into 1 mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes and stored at -80 °C. cfDNA BCTs were 
recapped and stored at −20 °C to preserve the red blood cell pellet. 
PAXgene blood RNA tubes were processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Briefly, tubes were left upright for a minimum of 2 hours before freezing at −20 °C. For RNA 
extraction, tubes were thawed and processed with the PAXgene blood RNA kit (Qiagen, 
#762164). 
Extracellular Vesicles and Particles (EVPs) Isolation 
One 4 mL K2 EDTA tube was shipped on ice overnight to WCM for processing. Blood was 
centrifuged at 500x g for 10 minutes, then plasma was transferred to a new tube and 
centrifuged at 3000 x g for 20 minutes, and the supernatant was collected and stored at -80 °C 
for EVP isolation. Plasma volumes ranged between 0.6 - 1.7 ml. Plasma was later thawed for 
downstream processing, when concentrations were measured. Plasma samples were thawed 
on ice, and EVPs were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation (Hoshino et al., 2020). 
Samples were centrifuged at 12,000x g for 20 minutes to remove microvesicles, then EVPs 
were collected by ultracentrifugation in a Beckman Coulter Optima XE or XPE 
ultracentrifuge at 100,000x g for 70 minutes. EVPs were then washed in PBS and pelleted 
again by ultracentrifugation at 100,000x g for 70 minutes. The final EVP pellet was 
resuspended in PBS. 
Dried blood spot (DBS) 
Crew members warmed their hands and massaged their finger towards the fingertip to enrich 
blood flow toward the puncture site. The puncture site was sterilized using a BZK antiseptic 
towelette (Dynarex, Reorder No. 1303). Skin was punctured using a contact-activated lancet 
(BD Biosciences, #366593) or a 21-gauge needle (BD Biosciences, #305167), depending on 
crew member preference. Capillary blood was collected onto the Whatman 903 Protein Saver 
DBS cards (Cytiva, #10534612). Blood was transferred by touching only the blood droplet to 
the surface of the DBS card. DBS cards were stored at room temperature with a desiccant 
pack (Cytiva, #10548239). 
Saliva 

To collect crude saliva, crew members uncapped and spit into a sterile, PCR-clean, 5 mL 
screw-cap tube (Eppendorf, 30122330). Crew spit repeatedly until at least 1 mL was 
collected. Saliva was transported to a sterile flow hood and separated into 500uL aliquots. 
Aliquots were frozen at -80 °C. To collect preserved saliva, crew members used the 
OMNIgene ORAL kit (OME-505). Crew members spit into the kit’s tube until they reached 
the fill line. The tube was re-capped, which released the preservative liquid. Tubes were 
inverted to mix the saliva and preservative before being placed at −20 °C for storage. After all 
timepoints were collected, DNA, RNA, and protein were extracted using the AllPrep 
DNA/RNA/Protein kit (Qiagen, #47054). Sample concentrations were measured with Qubit 
high sensitivity dsDNA and RNA platform. Proteins were quantified with the Pierce™ Rapid 
Gold BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, #A53225) on Promega GloMax Plate 
Reader. 
Urine 
Crew members urinated into sterile specimen containers (Thermo Scientific, #13-711-56). 
The container was stored at 4 C until it was prepared for long-term storage. To prepare urine 
samples for long-term storage, urine was aliquoted into 1 mL, 15 mL, and 50 mL tubes. Half 
of the urine was immediately placed at −80 °C. The other half had urine conditioning buffer 
(Zymo, #D3061-1-140) added to the sample before placing in the -80 °C freezer. 
Stool collection 
Crew members isolated a stool sample using a paper toilet accessory (DNA Genotek, OM-
AC1). Stool was transferred into and OMNIgene•GUT tube (DNAgenotek, OMR−200) and 
an OMNImet•GUT tube (DNA Genotek, ME−200). Tubes were placed at -80 °C for long-
term storage. For nucleic acid extraction, 200uL of each tube was allocated for DNA 
extraction with the QIAGEN PowerFecal Pro kit and 200uL was allocated to RNA extraction 
with the QIAGEN PowerViral kit. The remaining sample was split into 500uL aliquots and 
re-stored at -80 °C. 
Swab collection 
Crew members put on gloves and remove a sterile DNA/RNA swab (Isohelix, SK-4S) from 
its packaging. For collection of the postauricular, axillary vault, volar forearm, occiput, 
umbilicus, gluteal crease, glabella, toe web space, and capsule environment regions, swabs 
were dipped in nuclease-free water (this step was skipped for oral and nasal swabs) for 
ground collections. For in-flight collections, HFactor hydrogen infused water was used in 
place of nuclease-free water. Each body location was swabbed for 30 seconds, using both 
sides of the swab. Swabs were then placed in 1 mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes containing 400uL 
of DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo). The tip of the swab was broken off so that only the swab tip 
was stored in the Matrix 2D Screw Tube. Tubes were stored at 4 C. 
Skin biopsies 
Skin biopsies were performed on the deltoid region of the arm. Each site was prepared by 
application of ChloraPrep and anesthesia was induced with administration of 1% lidocaine 
with 1:100,000 epinephrine. A trephine punch was used to remove a 3- or 4-mm diameter 
piece of skin. The resected piece was cut into approximately 1/3 and 2/3 sections. The smaller 

piece was added to a formalin-filled specimen jar. The larger piece was placed in a cryovial 
and stored at -80 °C. Surgical defects were closed with 1 or 2 5-0 or 4-0 nylon sutures. 
HEPA filter 
HEPA Filter was taken apart and sectioned under a chemical hood to avoid contamination. 
The filter contained two parts, an activated carbon component and a HEPA filter. The 
activated carbon component was discarded and the filter was sectioned using a sterile blade. 
Sections were placed in individual specimen containers and stored at −20 °C.","Abstract 
The SpaceX Inspiration4 mission provided a unique opportunity to study the impact of 
spaceflight on the human body. Biospecimen samples were collected from four crew 
members longitudinally before (Launch: L-92, L-44, L-3 days), during (Flight Day: FD1, 
FD2, FD3), and after (Return: R + 1, R + 45, R + 82, R + 194 days) spaceflight, spanning a 
total of 289 days across 2021-2022. The collection process included venous whole blood, 
capillary dried blood spot cards, saliva, urine, stool, body swabs, capsule swabs, SpaceX 
Dragon capsule HEPA filter, and skin biopsies. Venous whole blood was further processed to 
obtain aliquots of serum, plasma, extracellular vesicles and particles, and peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells. In total, 2,911 sample aliquots were shipped to our central lab at Weill 
Cornell Medicine for downstream assays and biobanking. This paper provides an overview of 
the extensive biospecimen collection and highlights their processing procedures and long-
term biobanking techniques, facilitating future molecular tests and evaluations.As such, this 
study details a robust framework for obtaining and preserving high-quality human, microbial, 
and environmental samples for aerospace medicine in the Space Omics and Medical Atlas 
(SOMA) initiative, which can aid future human spaceflight and space biology experiments.

Introduction 
Our human space exploration efforts are at a unique transition point in history, with more 
crewed launches and human presence in space than ever before1. We can attribute this to the 
commercial spaceflight sector entering an industrial renaissance, with multiple companies 
forming collaborative and competitive networks to send commercial astronauts into space. 
The recent advancements in human space exploration offer a significant chance to gather 
more biological research samples and enhance our comprehension of spaceflight’s effects on 
human health. This is vital, as our knowledge of the biological reactions to the unique 
environment of space, marked by microgravity and the space radiation, remains incomplete2. 

The impact of spaceflight on human health includes musculoskeletal deconditioning3, 
cardiovascular adaptations4, vision changes5, space motion sickness6, neurovestibular 
changes7, immune dysfunction8, and increased risk of rare cancers9, among other changes2. 
However, we are still at the initial stages of documenting biological responses to spaceflight 
exposure at the molecular and cellular resolution. 
 
Prior work has characterized molecular changes that occur during spaceflight in astronauts. 
These include changes in cytokine profiles8,10,11, urinary albumin abundance12, and 
hemolysis13. Furthermore, multiomic assays have provided genomic maps of structural 
changes in DNA14–16, RNA expression profiles11,17,18, sample-wide protein measurements17,19,20, 
and metabolomic status17. Additionally, International Space Station (ISS) surfaces have been 
studied with longitudinal microbial profiles to track microbial pathogenicity and evolution to 
assess their potential influence on crew health21,22. To better improve our understanding of 
both human and microbial biology in space, it is critical that these analyses continue and 
expand as more spacecraft and stations are built and flown. 
Combining and comparing work from prior missions in these new spacecraft and stations is 
especially important to overcome the small sample sizes and highlights a need for 
standardization between missions. In addition, recruiting large cohorts of astronauts is 
difficult, as the ISS typically can only house up to six astronauts at a time. As of the time of 
writing, only 647 humans have been to space, starting with the launch of Yuri Gagarin in 
1961. Studies have spanned the Vostok program, Project Mercury, the Voskhod program, 
Project Gemini, Project Apollo, the Soyuz program, the Salyut space stations, MIR, the Space 
Shuttle Program, SkyLab, Tiangong Space Station, and the ISS. From the breadth of 
experiments that have been performed on the ISS, only a minority have specifically been 
human research-oriented23,24, and just a subset involve omics studies. The NASA Twin Study 
created the most in-depth multi-omic study of astronauts prior to Inspiration4, but was limited 
to one astronaut and one ground control17. These factors have limited the statistical power of 
astronaut omic experiments and increased the difficulty of providing robust scientific 
conclusions. Standardizing biospecimen collections across multiple missions will create 
larger sample sets needed to draw these conclusions. 

Here, we establish the standard biospecimen sample collection and banking procedures for 
the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA). A key goal of SOMA is to standardize 
biospecimen collection and processing for spaceflight, to generate high-quality multi-omics 
data across spaceflight investigations, and to enable follow-up experiments with viably frozen 
cells and biobanked samples. This paper provides sample collection methods built for 
standardized field collections across different crews and missions. We cover the decentralized 
sample collection process from the Inspiration4 (I4) mission from the point of collection to 
the preservation of samples for downstream biochemical and omics processing at our 
centralized lab at Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM). These protocols can produce synchronized 
datasets with enhanced statistical strength, amplifying our scientific findings from spaceflight 
studies. Additionally, we showcase metrics related to sample collection outputs, references of 
past astronaut sample collections in scientific publications, and suggestions to refine sample 
collection for upcoming missions. In its inaugural use case, these samples were collected 
from the I4 astronaut cohort and are currently in use for several other missions (Polaris 
Dawn, Axiom-2), which will enable continued utilization for future crewed space missions. 
 
Results 
 
Biospecimen collection overview 
We formulated and executed a sampling plan that spans a wide range of biospecimen 
samples: venous blood, capillary dried blood spots (DBSs), saliva, urine, stool, skin swabs, 
skin biopsies, and environmental swabs (Fig. 1a). The collection of various types of samples 
covered the scope of previous assays on astronaut samples (Supplementary Table 1), but also 
enabled newer omics technologies, such as spatially resolved, single-molecule, and single-
cell assays.

biospecimen sample collection. “L-” denotes the number of days prior to launch. “R + ” 
denotes the number of days after return to Earth. “FD” denotes which day of the flight a 
sample was collected. c Location of each collection timepoint. 
For the I4 mission, sample collection spanned three-time points pre-launch (L-92, L-44, L-3 
days), three-time points during flight (Flight Day 1 (FD1), FD2, FD3), and four-time points 
post-return (R + 1, R + 45, R + 82, R + 194 days). Venous blood, urine, stool, and skin 
biopsies were collected during ground timepoints only, while capillary DBSs, saliva, and skin 
swabs were collected both on the ground and during flight (Fig. 1b). Environmental swabs of 
the Dragon capsule were collected pre-flight in the crew training capsule and during flight in 
the spacecraft launched from Cape Canaveral (Fig. 1b). 
Samples were collected across a variety of locations based on the crew’s training and travel 
schedule. L-92 and L-44 were collected in Hawthorne, CA at SpaceX Headquarters, L-3 and 
R + 1 were collected at Cape Canaveral, FL at a facility near the launch site. FD1, FD2, and 
FD3 were collected inside the Dragon capsule while in orbit. R + 45 was collected at the crew 

members’ individual locations (which spanned the US States NY, NJ, TN, and WA), R + 82 
was collected at Weill Cornell Medicine, NY and R + 194 was collected at Baylor College of 
Medicine, TX (Fig. 1c). All samples from ground timepoints were processed within 16 hours 
of collection. All samples from the flight were processed immediately after retrieval from the 
flight. 
Samples were stored at −80 °C at each site immediately after processing and aliquoting 
(processing steps are outlined below). All samples were shipped via FedEx using Overnight 
Shipping to Weill Cornell Medicine for storage in the Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank 
(CAMbank) within 1 week of collection on dry ice in styrofoam boxes and spent <2 days in 
transit. No samples were shipped on a Thursday or Friday to avoid weekend shipping delays. 
All samples arrived at Weill Cornell Medicine with dry-ice still in the packaging and samples 
frozen. Samples were immediately transferred to −80 °C for long-term storage and 
biobanking. Any exceptions to this process will be noted below. In total, we collected 2,911 
sample aliquots, which were then processed in our central lab at Weill Cornell Medicine for 
downstream assays (Supplementary Table 2). Some samples were processed immediately at 
field laboratory facilities (Supplementary Data Fig. 1). DNA and RNA yields are also 
reported below from collection kits (saliva and stool) after arrival at WCM. 
Blood collection and derivatives 
Blood was collected using a combination of venipuncture tubes to collect venous blood and 
contact-activated lancets to collect capillary blood from the fingertip. Each crew member 
provided blood samples, collected into one BD PAXgene blood RNA tube (bRNA), four BD 
Vacutainer K2 EDTA tubes, two BD Vacutainer cell preparation tubes (CPTs), one Streck 
cell-free DNA tube (cfDNA BCT), one BD Vacutainer serum separator tube (SST), and one 
DBS card per time point. Tubes were transported from the collection site to the field 
laboratory at room temperature. From these tubes, whole blood, plasma, PBMCs, serum, and 
cell pellet samples were collected (Supplementary Table 3). Sample yields are reported 
below. Samples were aliquoted for long-term storage and biobanking (Supplementary 
Table 4). 
bRNA tubes were collected in order to isolate total RNA using the PAXgene blood RNA kit 
(Fig. 2a). Yield ranged from 3.04 to 14.04 µg/tube of total RNA across all samples, and the 
RNA integrity number (RIN) ranged from 3.2 to 8.5 (mean: 6.95) (Fig. 2b). RNA was stored 
at −80 °C after extraction. The collection of total RNA enables a variety of downstream RNA 
profiling methods. It will allow comparative studies to prior RNA-sequencing performed on 
astronauts, particularly snoRNA & lncRNA biomarkers analyzed from Space Shuttle era 
blood25,26, mRNA & miRNA measured during the NASA Twin Study17,18, and whole blood 
RNA arrays from the ISS27,28. Additionally, RNA yields are more than sufficient to perform 
direct-RNA sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platforms, which 
require 500 ng of total RNA per library (Manufacturer’s protocol, ONT kit SQK-RNA002). 
This enables the study of RNA modification changes during spaceflight to create 
epitranscriptomic profiles for the first time in astronauts.

Four K2 EDTA tubes were drawn at each timepoint from each crew member (Fig. 2c). One 
K2 EDTA tube was submitted to Quest Diagnostics to perform a complete blood count 
(CBC, Quest Test Code: 6399). One tube was used to isolate extracellular vesicles and 
particles (EVPs) for proteomic quantification (Fig. 3a). Total EVP quantities varied from 
2.71-28.27 ug (Fig. 2d). Two K2 EDTA tubes were used to isolate PBMCs for single-cell 
sequencing (10X Chromium Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression and Chromium 
Single Cell Immune Profiling workflows). After collection, a Ficoll separation was 
performed to isolate PBMCs, which ranged from 340,000-975,000 cells per mL of blood 
(Fig. 2e). One prior single-cell gene expression experiment, NASA Twin study, was 
performed on astronauts, which found immune cell population specific gene expression 
changes and a correlation with microRNA signatures11,18.

according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Fig. 3b). Plasma volume per tube ranged from 
3000-14,000 uL per tube (Fig. 4d). Because of technical issues in the sample processing 
procedure, three instances occurred where plasma retrieval from the CPT tubes was not 
possible. Plasma can be used to validate or refute previous studies, including cytokine 
panel10,29, exosomal RNA-seq25,26, extracellular vesicle microRNA30, and proteomic20,31–

nitrogen after slowly cooled in a Mr. Frosty to -80 °C. These can be used to follow-up on 
previous studies on adaptive immunity, cell function, and immune dysregulation8,34–39. The 
remaining red blood cell pellet mixtures from below the gel plug in each CPT Tube were 
stored at −20 °C.

(Streck) BCT plasma volumes per timepoint. fSST serum volumes per timepoint. An extra 
tube was drawn for C004 at R + 45, resulting in a higher serum yield. 
cfDNA BCT (Streck) tubes were collected to isolate high-quality cfDNA from plasma. 
cfDNA BCTs were spun and aliquoted according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Fig. 3c). 
The remaining cell pellet mixture was frozen at −20 °C. Plasma volume per timepoint ranged 
from 1500-5000 uL (Fig. 4e). 500 uL aliquots were frozen at -80 °C. cfDNA extracted from 
these tubes can be analyzed for fragment length, mitochondrial or nuclear origin, and cell 
type or tissue of origin40–42. 

The SST was spun and aliquoted according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Fig. 3d). 
Serum volume ranged from 2000-8000 uL per timepoint (Fig. 4f). Similar to plasma, serum 
can be allocated for cytokine analysis and can also be used to perform comprehensive 
metabolic panels, including one we used at Quest (CMP, Quest Test Code: 10231) for metrics 
on alkaline phosphatase, calcium, glucose, potassium, and sodium, among other metabolic 
markers. The remaining cell pellet mixture from each SST tube was stored at −20 °C. 
In addition to venous blood, capillary blood was collected onto a DBS card using a contact-
activated lancet pressed against the fingertip (Fig. 5a). Capillary blood was collected onto a 
Whatman 903 Protein Saver DBS card to preserve nucleic acids and proteins. Each of the five 
spots on the DBS card hold 75-80uL of capillary blood, however, the amount of capillary 
blood collected across timepoints varied (Fig. 5b, c) according to how much blood could be 
collected before the lancet-puncture closed.

a DBS cards were collected preflight, during flight, and postflight. There were five spots for 
blood collection per card. b Blood collections varied in saturation level across blood spots 
and timepoints. These were classified as “full”, “partial”, and occasionally “empty”. c DBS 
card yields per blood spot, per timepoint, and per crew member. 
Saliva collection 
Saliva was collected at the L-92, L-44, L-3, FD1, FD2, FD3, R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 
timepoints using two methods. First, saliva was collected using the OMNIgene Oral Kit 

(OME-505), which preserves nucleic acids (Fig. 6a) during the ground timepoints. From 
these samples, DNA, RNA, and protein were extracted. DNA yield ranged from 28.1 to 
3187.8 ng, RNA yield from 396.0 to 3544.2 ng (less the two samples had concentrations too 
low for measurement), and protein concentration from 92.97 to 93.15 ng.

collected per timepoint. 
Second, crude saliva (i.e., saliva with no preservative added) was collected into a 5 mL 
DNase/RNase-free screw top tube during the ground and flight timepoints. Saliva volume 
varied from 150 to 4000 uL per tube (Fig. 6b). Crude saliva was also collected during flight 
(FD2 and FD3), in addition to the ground timepoints. 
Saliva collections have been conducted throughout spaceflight studies for assessing the 
immune state of crews, particularly in the context of viral reactivation. Previously identified 
viruses that reactivate during spaceflight include Epstein–Barr, varicella-zoster, and 
cytomegalovirus43. Responses to reactivation of these viruses can be asymptomatic, 
debilitating, or even life-threatening, thus assessing these adaptations is beneficial in 
understanding viral spaceflight activity as well as crew health. In addition to viral nucleic 
acid quantification, numerous biochemical assays can also be performed, including 

measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and 
cytokines, among others10,43–46. 
Urine collection 
Urine was collected in sterile specimen cups at the L-92, L-44, L-3, R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 
timepoints. Specimen cups were collected 1-2 times per day. For preservation, urine was 
aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Half the urine had Zymo Urine Conditioning Buffer (UCB) 
added before freezing, to preserve nucleic acids. Samples yielded 23–155.5 mL of crude urine 
and 21 - 112 mL of UCB urine per specimen cup (Fig. 7a). Urine was split into 1 mL - 15 mL 
aliquots before freezing at -80 °C.

A wide variety of assays can be performed on urine samples. Previous studies have included 
viral reactivation43,46,47, urinary cortisol48,49, iron and magnesium measurements50–53, bone 
status54–56, kidney stones54,55, proteomics11, telomere measurements57, and various biomarkers 
and metabolites17,49,58–61. 
Stool collection 

Stool was collected at the L-92, L-44, R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 timepoints. Stool samples 
were stored into two collection containers at each timepoint, one DNA Genotek OMNIgene 
Gut (OMR−200) kit with a preservative for metagenomics and another (ME−200) with a 
preservative for metabolomics (Fig. 7b). Stool was the least consistent sample collected due 
to the limited windows available for sampling during collection timeframes. DNA and RNA 
were extracted from aliquots of the OMNIgene Gut (OMR−200) tubes for downstream 
microbiome analysis. DNA yield ranged from 358.5 to 16,660 ng, RNA from 690 to 2010 ng 
(Fig. 7c). Large variations in yield are attributable to variable stool mass collected between 
kits. 
Stool samples enable various biochemical, immune, and microbiome changes studies. 
Previous metagenomic assays have found that shannon alpha diversity and richness during 
long-duration missions to the ISS62. 
Skin swabs 
Body swabs were collected at all timepoints. Samples were collected by swabbing the body 
region of interest for 30 seconds, then placing the swab in a sterile 2D matrix tube (Thermo 
Scientific #3710) with Zymo DNA/RNA shield preservative. For the first two swab locations, 
the oral and nasal cavity, the swab was placed directly on the body after removal from its 
sterile packaging (dry-swab method; Fig. 8a). For the remaining body locations, the swab was 
briefly dipped in nuclease-free, DNA/RNA-free water before proceeding (wet-swab method). 
Eight distinct sites were swabbed with the wet-swab method: post-auricular, axillary vault, 
volar forearm, occiput, umbilicus, gluteal crease, glabella, and the toe-web space (Fig. 8b). 
The astronaut microbiome has previously been studied in the forehead, forearm, nasal, 
armpit, navel, postauricular, and tongue body locations, and changes have been documented 
during flight. Changes in alpha diversity and beta diversity were documented, as well as 
shifts in microbial genera62. However, the impact of these changes on skin health and 
immunological health are not well understood. 
Fig. 8. Skin Collection Locations and Sample Types. 

 
Open in a new tab 
a Dry swabs were collected from two body locations. b Wet swabs were collected from eight 
body locations. c Swabs were collected from the deltoid region. Immediately after, 3- or 4-
mm skin biopsies were collected from the same area and divided for histology and spatially 
resolved transcriptomics. 
Acquiring extensive swab samples from the crew skin allows for characterization of the 
habitat environment, crew skin microbiome adaptations, and interactions with potential 
human health adaptations resulting from spaceflight exposure. This is very relevant for crew 
health, considering astronauts become more susceptible to infections during spaceflight 
missions63, with the relationship between microbe-host interactions from spaceflight 
exposure, which may be a causative factor of astronauts immune dysfunction, which is still 
not well understood. 
Skin Biopsies 
A skin biopsy on the deltoid was obtained from the L-44 and R + 1 timepoint. Biopsies were 
also collected in advance of a flight to ensure the biopsy site is fully healed before the flight 
so there is no risk of complication. The wet-swab method was used to collect the skin 
microbiome before the skin biopsy. The skin biopsies were 3–4 millimeters in diameter and 
were collected for histology and spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) (Fig. 8c). One-third 
of the sample was stored in formalin and kept at room temperature to perform histology. The 
remaining two-thirds of the sample was stored in a cryovial and placed at -80 °C for SRT 
(Fig. 8c). This is the first sample collected from astronauts for spatially resolved 
transcriptomics. The skin is of high interest due to the inflammation-related cytokine markers 
such as IL-12p40, IL-10, IL-17A, and IL-1810,17 and skin rash’s status as the most frequent 
clinical symptom reported during spaceflight64. 

Environmental swabs and HEPA filter 
Environmental swabs were collected in flight during the F1 and F2 timepoint. Additionally, 
environmental swabs were collected from the flight simulation capsule at SpaceX 
headquarters after days of crew training during the L-92 and L-44 timepoints. Environmental 
swabs were collected using the wet-swab method. Ten environmental swabs were collected 
per time point at the following locations in the capsule: an ambient air/control swab, the 
execute button, the viewing dome, the side hatch mobility aid, the lid of the waste locker, the 
head section of one of the seats, the commode panel, the right and left sides of the control 
screen, and the g-meter button (Fig. 9a-d). Additionally, the spacecraft’s high-efficiency 
particulate absorbing (HEPA) filter was acquired post-flight. This filter was cut into 127 
rectangular pieces (1.2” x 1.6” x 4”) and stored at −20 °C.

Previous microbial profiling of spacecraft environments has revealed that equipment 
sterilized on the ground becomes coated in microbial life in space due to interactions with 
crew and the introduction of equipment that has not undergone sterilization65. Subsequent 
microbial monitoring assays performed on the ISS have detected novel, spaceflight-specific 
species on the ISS66. Once in space, surface microbes are subject to the unique microgravity 
and radiation environment of flight, which will influence evolutionary trajectory. The 
potential impact of this influence on pathogenesis is a concern for long-duration space 
missions, especially given that changes in host-pathogen interactions may also be affected 
during spaceflight67. 
Discussion 
We report here on biospecimen samples collected from the SpaceX I4 Mission, the most 
comprehensive human biological specimen collection effort performed on an astronaut cohort 
to date. The extensive archive of biospecimens included venous blood, dried blood spot 
cards, saliva, urine, stool, microbiome body swabs, skin biopsies, and environmental capsule 
swabs. The study objective was to establish a foundational set of methods for biospecimen 
collection and banking on commercial spaceflight missions suitable for multi-omic and 
molecular analysis. Biospecimens were collected to enable comprehensive, multi-omic 
profiles, which can then be used to develop molecular catalogs with higher resolution of 
human responses to spaceflight. Select, targeted measures in clinical labs (CLIA) were also 
performed immediately after sample collection (CBC, CMP), and samples and viable cells 
were preserved in a long-term Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank, such that additional 
assays and measures can be conducted in the future. 
Great care was put into the standardization of sample processing between field laboratories in 
Hawthorne, Cape Canaveral, and Houston. Despite our best efforts to control for all 
preanalytical variables68, there are some inconsistencies in sample processing that were 
unavoidable during this mission. Of note, there was no access to cold stowage during flight, 
causing all samples to be stowed at room temperature until they arrived back on Earth. Of the 
three sample types collected during flight, two were stable at room temperature (skin/capsule 
swabs stored in DNA/RNA shield and capillary blood collected on dried blood spot cards). 
The third (saliva samples), were not stored in a preservative and, for this reason, will have a 
distinct profile compared to other timepoints. This limits the context in which these samples 
will be useful, but will still provide biological insights in more targeted biological studies. 
We can imagine situations in the future where there will be tradeoffs between standardization 
of sample collection with previous missions and mission-specific constraints influencing the 
selection of biospecimen collection methods. 
However, there are several reasons why rigorous biospecimen collection methods for 
commercial and private spaceflight missions must be developed, which are scalable and 
translational across populations, missions, and mission parameters. First, little is known about 

the biological and clinical responses that occur in civilians during and after space travel. 
While professional astronauts are generally young, healthy, and extensively trained, civilian 
astronauts have been, and likely will be, far more heterogeneous. They will possess a variety 
of phenotypes, including older ages, different health backgrounds, and greater medication 
use, and may experience different medical conditions, risks, and comorbidities. Careful 
molecular characterization will be beneficial for the development of appropriate baseline 
metrics and countermeasures and, therefore, beneficial for the individual spaceflight 
experience. In the future, such analyses may enable precision medicine applications aimed at 
optimizing countermeasures for each individual astronaut who enters and returns safely from 
space69,70. 
Second, multi-omic studies inherently present a large number of measurements within a small 
set of subjects. These high-dimensional datasets present numerous potential challenges with 
regard to the amplification of noise, risk of overfitting, and false discoveries71. At all times, 
scientists engaged in multi-omic analyses must take special care that true biological variance 
is what has been measured. The introduction of experimental variance through the 
progression from sample collection, transport, and storage, to sequencing and analysis can 
introduce artifacts of variance that render the detection of true biological variance and 
interpretation of results more difficult. For this reason, tight adherence to experimental 
controls or annotation at every step of the experimental condition is crucial. Careful 
annotation allows for the assignment of class variables in post hoc analysis. Among such 
applications are the attempt to detect batch effects or determine the impact of variations in 
temperature (collection, storage, or transport)72. 
The necessary means to address experimental variance are longitudinal sampling and 
specimen aliquoting. Longitudinal sampling (i.e. collecting numerous serial samples from 
each test condition) from pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight allows for greater statistical 
power when assessing changes attributable to spaceflight. In addition, each sample collected 
should be divided upon collection into multiple aliquots. This better assures that freeze-thaw 
cycles can be avoided in the analysis stage, as freeze-thaw events can introduce considerable 
experimental variance depending on the molecular class being measured. Maintaining all 
samples at their optimal storage temperature at all times, typically -80 °C or lower (e.g. liquid 
nitrogen for cells), is crucial73. Special attention must be given to how the collection and 
storage methods in-flight vary in relation to the conditions on Earth. Spaceflight presents 
considerable differences in the operating environment, where ground conditions are far easier 
to control than flight. In practice, this may limit the types of samples that can be collected 
during flight. 
Third, rigorous methods must be developed and followed to pursue comparisons across 
missions with varying design parameters. In this consideration, there is an argument for the 
development of specimen collection, transport, storage, processing, analysis, and reporting 
standards. At the same time, this must be balanced with the flexibility required for innovation 
since standards can sometimes limit advancement in methodology. In the present study, 
common methods were used for the I4 and the Polaris Dawn and Axiom-2 missions. 
However, selected methods may require optimization for Polaris Dawn-like missions, to 
increase the yields during sample processing and adapt to unique parameters imposed by the 
anticipated spacewalk (extravehicular activity; EVA). Moreover, within standards or best 
practices, unique research for each mission may require alteration of previously successful 

methods. With these considerations in mind, we must balance methodology standardization 
with advances in methodology options and mission-specific objectives. 
As the commercial spaceflight sector gains momentum and more astronauts with different 
health profiles and backgrounds have access to space, comprehensive data on the biological 
impact of short-duration spaceflight is of paramount importance. Such data will further 
expand our understanding and knowledge of how spaceflight affects human physiology, 
microbial adaptations, and environmental biology. The use of integrative omics technologies 
for civilian astronauts has revealed novel responses across genomics, proteomics, 
metabolomics, microbiome, and transcriptomics measures74–83. Creating multi-omic datasets 
from spaceflight studies on astronaut cohorts will further advance our understanding, inform 
future mission planning, and help discover what appropriate countermeasures can be 
developed to minimize future risk and enhance performance. 
Validating sample collection methodologies initially in short-duration commercial spaceflight 
is a key step for future human health research in long-duration and exploration-class missions 
to the Moon and beyond. To help meet these challenges, we have established the SOMA 
protocols, which detail standard multi-omic measures of astronaut health and protocols for 
sample collection from astronaut cohorts. Although the all-civilian I4 crew pioneered the first 
use of the SOMA protocols, the methodology outlined here is robust and generalizable, 
making it applicable to future astronaut crews from any commercial mission provider (e.g., 
SpaceX, Axiom Space, Sierra Space, Blue Origin) or space agencies (NASA, ESA, JAXA, 
ROSCOSMOS). Furthermore, the SOMA banking, sequencing, and processing methods are a 
springboard for continuing biospecimen analysis and expanding our knowledge of multi-omic 
dynamics before, during, and after human spaceflight missions, providing a molecular 
roadmap for crew health, medical biometrics, and possible countermeasures. 
Methods 
Venous blood draw 
Venipuncture was performed on each subject using a BD Vacutainer® Safety-Lok™ blood 
collection set (BD Biosciences, #367281) and a Vacutainer one-use holder (BD Biosciences, 
364815). The puncture site was located near the cubital fossa and was sterilized with a BZK 
antiseptic towelette (Dynarex, Reorder No. 1303). Blood was collected into 1 serum separator 
tube (SST, BD Biosciences: #367987, Lot: #1158449, #1034773), 2 cell processing tubes 
(CPT, BD Biosciences: #362753, Lot: #1133477, #1012161), 1 blood RNA tube (bRNA, 
PAXgene: #762165, Lot: #1021333), 1 cell-free DNA BCT (cfDNA BCT, Streck: #230470, 
Lot: #11530331), and 4 K2 EDTA blood collection tubes (BD Biosciences, #367844, Lot: 
#0345756) per crew member per time point. For samples collected in Hawthorne, blood was 
drawn at SpaceX headquarters, then immediately transported to USC for processing. Samples 
collected at Cape Canaveral were processed on-site. 
Blood tube processing 
For processing, serum separator tubes (SST) were centrifuged at 1300x g for 10 minutes. 
500uL aliquots of serum were aliquoted into 1 mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes (ThermoFisher, 
3741-WP1D-BR) and stored at -80 °C. SST tubes were recapped and stored at −20 °C to 
preserve the red blood cell pellet. 

Cell processing tubes were centrifuged at 1800xg for 30 minutes. Plasma was aliquoted into 
1 mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes and stored at -80 °C. 5 mL of 2% FBS (ThermoFisher, 
#26140079) in PBS (ThermoFisher, #10010023) was added to the CPT tube to resuspend 
PBMCs. PBMC suspension was transferred to a clean 15 mL conical tube. The total volume 
was brought to 15 mL with 2% FBS in PBS. The tube was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 
300x g. Supernatant was discarded. PBMCs were resuspended 6 mL of 10% DMSO 
(Millipore Sigma, #D4540-500mL) in FBS. 1 mL of PBMCs were moved to 6 cryogenic 
vials (Corning, #8672). Cryovials were placed in a Mr. FrostyTM (ThermoFisher, #5100-0001) 
and stored at -80 °C. CPTs were recapped and stored at −20 °C to preserve the red blood cell 
pellet. There was one outlier to this sample collection, the R + 194 timepoint, where CPT 
sodium citrate tubes were used (BD Biosciences, Cat no. 362760). 
cfDNA BCTs were centrifuged at 300xg for 20 minutes. Plasma was transferred to a 15 mL 
conical tube. Plasma was centrifuged 5000xg for 10 minutes. 500uL aliquots of plasma were 
aliquoted into 1 mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes and stored at -80 °C. cfDNA BCTs were 
recapped and stored at −20 °C to preserve the red blood cell pellet. 
PAXgene blood RNA tubes were processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Briefly, tubes were left upright for a minimum of 2 hours before freezing at −20 °C. For RNA 
extraction, tubes were thawed and processed with the PAXgene blood RNA kit (Qiagen, 
#762164). 
Extracellular Vesicles and Particles (EVPs) Isolation 
One 4 mL K2 EDTA tube was shipped on ice overnight to WCM for processing. Blood was 
centrifuged at 500x g for 10 minutes, then plasma was transferred to a new tube and 
centrifuged at 3000 x g for 20 minutes, and the supernatant was collected and stored at -80 °C 
for EVP isolation. Plasma volumes ranged between 0.6 - 1.7 ml. Plasma was later thawed for 
downstream processing, when concentrations were measured. Plasma samples were thawed 
on ice, and EVPs were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation (Hoshino et al., 2020). 
Samples were centrifuged at 12,000x g for 20 minutes to remove microvesicles, then EVPs 
were collected by ultracentrifugation in a Beckman Coulter Optima XE or XPE 
ultracentrifuge at 100,000x g for 70 minutes. EVPs were then washed in PBS and pelleted 
again by ultracentrifugation at 100,000x g for 70 minutes. The final EVP pellet was 
resuspended in PBS. 
Dried blood spot (DBS) 
Crew members warmed their hands and massaged their finger towards the fingertip to enrich 
blood flow toward the puncture site. The puncture site was sterilized using a BZK antiseptic 
towelette (Dynarex, Reorder No. 1303). Skin was punctured using a contact-activated lancet 
(BD Biosciences, #366593) or a 21-gauge needle (BD Biosciences, #305167), depending on 
crew member preference. Capillary blood was collected onto the Whatman 903 Protein Saver 
DBS cards (Cytiva, #10534612). Blood was transferred by touching only the blood droplet to 
the surface of the DBS card. DBS cards were stored at room temperature with a desiccant 
pack (Cytiva, #10548239). 
Saliva 

To collect crude saliva, crew members uncapped and spit into a sterile, PCR-clean, 5 mL 
screw-cap tube (Eppendorf, 30122330). Crew spit repeatedly until at least 1 mL was 
collected. Saliva was transported to a sterile flow hood and separated into 500uL aliquots. 
Aliquots were frozen at -80 °C. To collect preserved saliva, crew members used the 
OMNIgene ORAL kit (OME-505). Crew members spit into the kit’s tube until they reached 
the fill line. The tube was re-capped, which released the preservative liquid. Tubes were 
inverted to mix the saliva and preservative before being placed at −20 °C for storage. After all 
timepoints were collected, DNA, RNA, and protein were extracted using the AllPrep 
DNA/RNA/Protein kit (Qiagen, #47054). Sample concentrations were measured with Qubit 
high sensitivity dsDNA and RNA platform. Proteins were quantified with the Pierce™ Rapid 
Gold BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, #A53225) on Promega GloMax Plate 
Reader. 
Urine 
Crew members urinated into sterile specimen containers (Thermo Scientific, #13-711-56). 
The container was stored at 4 C until it was prepared for long-term storage. To prepare urine 
samples for long-term storage, urine was aliquoted into 1 mL, 15 mL, and 50 mL tubes. Half 
of the urine was immediately placed at −80 °C. The other half had urine conditioning buffer 
(Zymo, #D3061-1-140) added to the sample before placing in the -80 °C freezer. 
Stool collection 
Crew members isolated a stool sample using a paper toilet accessory (DNA Genotek, OM-
AC1). Stool was transferred into and OMNIgene•GUT tube (DNAgenotek, OMR−200) and 
an OMNImet•GUT tube (DNA Genotek, ME−200). Tubes were placed at -80 °C for long-
term storage. For nucleic acid extraction, 200uL of each tube was allocated for DNA 
extraction with the QIAGEN PowerFecal Pro kit and 200uL was allocated to RNA extraction 
with the QIAGEN PowerViral kit. The remaining sample was split into 500uL aliquots and 
re-stored at -80 °C. 
Swab collection 
Crew members put on gloves and remove a sterile DNA/RNA swab (Isohelix, SK-4S) from 
its packaging. For collection of the postauricular, axillary vault, volar forearm, occiput, 
umbilicus, gluteal crease, glabella, toe web space, and capsule environment regions, swabs 
were dipped in nuclease-free water (this step was skipped for oral and nasal swabs) for 
ground collections. For in-flight collections, HFactor hydrogen infused water was used in 
place of nuclease-free water. Each body location was swabbed for 30 seconds, using both 
sides of the swab. Swabs were then placed in 1 mL Matrix 2D Screw Tubes containing 400uL 
of DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo). The tip of the swab was broken off so that only the swab tip 
was stored in the Matrix 2D Screw Tube. Tubes were stored at 4 C. 
Skin biopsies 
Skin biopsies were performed on the deltoid region of the arm. Each site was prepared by 
application of ChloraPrep and anesthesia was induced with administration of 1% lidocaine 
with 1:100,000 epinephrine. A trephine punch was used to remove a 3- or 4-mm diameter 
piece of skin. The resected piece was cut into approximately 1/3 and 2/3 sections. The smaller 

piece was added to a formalin-filled specimen jar. The larger piece was placed in a cryovial 
and stored at -80 °C. Surgical defects were closed with 1 or 2 5-0 or 4-0 nylon sutures. 
HEPA filter 
HEPA Filter was taken apart and sectioned under a chemical hood to avoid contamination. 
The filter contained two parts, an activated carbon component and a HEPA filter. The 
activated carbon component was discarded and the filter was sectioned using a sterile blade. 
Sections were placed in individual specimen containers and stored at −20 °C."

impact skeletal health. PubMed+1

resident microbes is challenging. This study proposes a metabolic modeling pipeline to 
design precision prebiotics that selectively promote growth of target beneficial

(BuOE, a SOD mimic) could ameliorate SR Ca²⁺ leak, SERCA dysfunction, and muscle 
atrophy after spaceflight. Nature+1 
●​ They used soleus muscle samples from mice flown ~35 days on ISS, treated with either 
saline or BuOE, and measured muscle mass, SERCA activity, SR Ca²⁺ leak (via 
ionophore ratio), oxidative damage markers (4-HNE), and protein expression. Nature+1 
●​ Their findings: spaceflight caused significant soleus muscle atrophy, elevated SR Ca²⁺ 
leak, and increased oxidative damage; BuOE treatment failed to rescue those defects. 
Nature+1 
●​ The authors conclude that spaceflight-induced Ca²⁺ leak and muscle deterioration are 
not mitigated by BuOE, suggesting other therapeutics (targeting SERCA activation or 
leak reduction) are needed. Nature+2bioRxiv+2 
Key Results 
●​ The soleus:body mass ratio was significantly reduced in flight versus controls, and 
BuOE did not attenuate this muscle atrophy. Nature+2bioRxiv+2 
●​ Maximal SERCA ATPase activity was unchanged; however, the ionophore ratio (a 
measure of Ca²⁺ leak relative to pumping) was increased (i.e. more leak) in flight, with 
no rescue by BuOE. Nature+2bioRxiv+2 
●​ Oxidative damage marker 4-HNE was elevated by spaceflight and was not reduced by 
BuOE treatment. Nature+2bioRxiv+2 
●​ BuOE modestly increased SERCA’s Ca²⁺ affinity (pCa₅₀) across groups, but that did not 
suffice to offset increased leak or functional deficits. Nature+1 
Conclusion / Implication 
●​ Spaceflight increases SR Ca²⁺ leak in skeletal muscle (soleus), contributing to muscle 
dysfunction and atrophy, and this cannot be reversed by BuOE antioxidant treatment. 
Nature+1 

●​ Even though BuOE showed some effect on SERCA affinity, it was insufficient to 
counteract leak and oxidative damage in this model. Nature+1 
●​ The findings suggest that countermeasures solely based on antioxidant therapy may not 
suffice; more targeted interventions aimed at stabilizing SERCA function or reducing leak 
are needed to protect muscle Ca²⁺ homeostasis in space."

Abstract (summary) 
●​ Spaceflight poses risks to the central nervous system (CNS), and understanding 
neurological responses is important for future missions. PubMed+1 
●​ The authors studied Drosophila melanogaster flies flown aboard the International Space 
Station (ISS) to compare effects of microgravity (SFμg) versus artificially simulated Earth 
gravity (SF1g) by inflight centrifugation as a countermeasure. PubMed+2PMC+2 
●​ Inflight behavior under microgravity (SFμg) showed increased activity, but postflight the 
flies had significant defects in climbing performance. PubMed+2PMC+2 
●​ Multi-omics (transcriptomics + proteomics) analysis revealed alterations in pathways 
related to metabolism, oxidative stress, and synaptic transmission in both SFμg and 
SF1g groups. PubMed+2Penn State+2 
●​ However, immediate postflight neurological changes — including neuronal loss, changes 
in glial cell counts, oxidative damage, and apoptosis — were seen only in the 
microgravity (SFμg) condition. PubMed+2Penn State+2 
●​ After return and acclimation to Earth conditions, both SF1g and SFμg brains showed 
progressive neuronal loss and glial phenotypes, with more severe effects in SFμg. 
PubMed+2Penn State+2 
●​ The authors conclude that artificial gravity (i.e. SF1g via centrifugation) partially 
protects the CNS from the adverse effects of spaceflight. PubMed+2PMC+2
