PMC4136787,PMC4136787_000,"After a 16-year hiatus, Russia has resumed its program of biomedical research in space, with the successful 30-day flight of the Bion-M 1 biosatellite (April 19–May 19, 2013). The principal species for biomedical research in this project was the mouse. This paper presents an overview of the scientific goals, the experimental design and the mouse training/selection program. The aim of mice experiments in the Bion-M 1 project was to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms, underlying the adaptation of key physiological systems to long-term exposure in microgravity. The studies with mice combined in vivo measurements, both in flight and post-flight (including continuous blood pressure measurement), with extensive in vitro studies carried out shortly after return of the mice and in the end of recovery study."
PMC4136787,PMC4136787_001,"Male C57/BL6 mice group housed in space habitats were flown aboard the Bion-M 1 biosatellite, or remained on ground in the control experiment that replicated environmental and housing conditions in the spacecraft. Vivarium control groups were used to account for housing effects and possible seasonal differences. Mice training included the co-adaptation in housing groups and mice adaptation to paste food diet. The measures taken to co-adapt aggressive male mice in housing groups and the peculiarities of “space” paste food are described. The training program for mice designated for in vivo studies was broader and included behavioral/functional test battery and continuous behavioral measurements in the home-cage. The results of the preliminary tests were used for the selection of homogenous groups."
PMC4136787,PMC4136787_002,"After the flight, mice were in good condition for biomedical studies and displayed signs of pronounced disadaptation to Earth's gravity. The outcomes of the training program for the mice welfare are discussed. We conclude that our training program was effective and that male mice can be successfully employed in space biomedical research. The Bion-M 1 flight was unique in many ways, particularly the unprecedented duration of an automated mission with living animals. The sex of the mice was male, thus imposing greater attention to creation and selection of stable groups of mice for social housing. The overall success was evident: aggressive interactions were noted on single occasions and under conditions of starvation only. The use of male animals is obviously required for research in male reproduction and their larger size compared to females offered clear advantages."
PMC4136787,PMC4136787_003,"Our program of mice training for flight and control experiments of the Bion-M 1 project was aimed to: ensure that mice adapt to stressful conditions of space flight when housed in groups; to collect baseline data from these mice; select homogenous groups; and, more generally, to promote collection of less variable data. The results of our program presented here demonstrate that group housed male mice need not be excluded a priori , but quite on the contrary, can be successfully employed in space biomedical research if clear and simple procedures provided by this study are followed. The failures in this project were connected with hardware malfunction in food distribution system and to microgravity-related changes in mouse behavior."
PMC4136787,PMC4136787_004,"Some of the injuries and deaths encountered in this pioneering effort suggest moving parts within the habitat present potential risks and should be avoided or carefully analyzed in the design of future mouse habitats. In this space experiment we have, for the first time, introduced implantable telemetry in these small laboratory animals. This shift to data collection during the flight became possible with the development of miniature implantable probes, thereby dramatically increasing the scientific output of such experiments. Moreover, the use of an automated data collection system during the post-flight stage of this experiment provided comprehensive data on the course and mechanism of recovery of varied physiological systems following exposure to microgravity."
PMC4136787,PMC4136787_005,"The unprecedented inclusion of daily video recordings proved valuable for scientific purposes, for animal welfare considerations, and for assessing both nominal and aberrant events. The good condition of spaceflight mice was the basis for the positive results of both the recovery and tissue sharing studies; leading us to conclude that our training program was generally effective. We express our hope that the results and considerations presented here will be useful for the planning of future missions and will help to ensure the welfare of rodents in space research."
PMC3630201,PMC3630201_000,"Bone is a dynamically remodeled tissue that requires gravity-mediated mechanical stimulation for maintenance of mineral content and structure. Homeostasis in bone occurs through a balance in the activities and signaling of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes, as well as proliferation and differentiation of their stem cell progenitors. Microgravity and unloading are known to cause osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; however, we hypothesize that osteocytic osteolysis, and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss in space. To test this possibility, we exposed 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (n = 8) to microgravity for 15-days on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Analysis of the pelvis by µCT shows decreases in bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of 6.29%, and bone thickness of 11.91%."
PMC3630201,PMC3630201_001,"TRAP-positive osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces also increased in microgravity by 170% (p = 0.004), indicating osteoclastic bone degeneration. High-resolution X-ray nanoCT studies revealed signs of lacunar osteolysis, including increases in cross-sectional area (+17%, p = 0.022), perimeter (+14%, p = 0.008), and canalicular diameter (+6%, p = 0.037). Expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 1, 3, and 10 in bone, as measured by RT-qPCR, was also up-regulated in microgravity (+12.94, +2.98 and +16.85 fold respectively, p<0.01), with MMP10 localized to osteocytes, and consistent with induction of osteocytic osteolysis. Furthermore, expression of CDKN1a/p21 in bone increased 3.31 fold (p<0.01), and was localized to osteoblasts, possibly inhibiting the cell cycle during tissue regeneration as well as conferring apoptosis resistance to these cells."
PMC3630201,PMC3630201_002,"Finally the apoptosis inducer Trp53 was down-regulated by −1.54 fold (p<0.01), possibly associated with the quiescent survival-promoting function of CDKN1a/p21. In conclusion, our findings identify the pelvic and femoral region of the mouse skeleton as an active site of rapid bone loss in microgravity, and indicate that this loss is not limited to osteoclastic degradation. Therefore, this study offers new evidence for microgravity-induced osteocytic osteolysis, and CDKN1a/p21-mediated osteogenic cell cycle arrest. In total, our findings demonstrate the pelvic-femoral musculo-skeletal complex as a highly load and gravity sensitive structure that can serve as a valuable model to study muscle and bone degeneration in space. Additionally, we demonstrate that bone responses to spaceflight are complex and involve osteoclastic, osteoblastic, and osteocytic degenerative responses."
PMC3630201,PMC3630201_003,"Finally, our findings on CDKN1a/p21 up-regulation in microgravity have the potential to become a major concern for tissue regenerative health in long-duration spaceflight. Future studies should address the specific molecular regulatory mechanisms of CDKN1a/p21 involvement in tissue degeneration during long-term spaceflight and the possibility of systemic activation of this strong molecular inhibitor of regenerative adult stem cell proliferation."
PMC11988870,PMC11988870_000,"Microgravity, defined by minimal gravitational forces, represents a unique environment that profoundly influences biological systems, including human cells. This review examines the effects of microgravity on biological processes and their implications for human health. Microgravity significantly impacts the immune system by disrupting key mechanisms, such as T cell activation, cytokine production, and macrophage differentiation, leading to increased susceptibility to infections. In cancer biology, it promotes the formation of spheroids in cancer stem cells and thyroid cancer cells, which closely mimic in vivo tumor dynamics, providing novel insights for oncology research. Additionally, microgravity enhances tissue regeneration by modulating critical pathways, including Hippo and PI3K-Akt, thereby improving stem cell differentiation into hematopoietic and cardiomyocyte lineages."
PMC11988870,PMC11988870_001,"At the organ level, microgravity induces notable changes in hepatic metabolism, endothelial function, and bone mechanotransduction, contributing to lipid dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and accelerated bone loss. Notably, cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells and cultured under microgravity exhibit enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved calcium handling, and advanced structural maturation, including increased sarcomere length and nuclear eccentricity. These advancements enable the development of functional cardiomyocytes, presenting promising therapeutic opportunities for treating cardiac diseases, such as myocardial infarctions. These findings underscore the dual implications of microgravity for space medicine and terrestrial health. They highlight its potential to drive advances in regenerative therapies, oncology, and immunological interventions."

PMC7998608,PMC7998608_000,"Therapeutic effects of adult stem-cell transplantations are limited by poor cell-retention in target organs, and a reduced potential for optimal cell differentiation compared to embryonic stem cells. However, contemporary studies have indicated heterogeneity within adult stem-cell pools, and a novel culturing technique may address these limitations by selecting those for cell proliferation which are highly functional. Here, we report the preservation of stemness in human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) by using microgravity conditions combined with microspheres in a stirred suspension. The cells were bound to microspheres (100−300 μm) and cultured using a wave-stirring shaker."
PMC7998608,PMC7998608_001,"One-week cultures using polystyrene and collagen microspheres increased the proportions of SSEA-3(+) hASCs 4.4- and 4.3-fold (2.7- and 2.9-fold increases in their numbers), respectively, compared to normal culture conditions. These cultured hASCs expressed higher levels of pluripotent markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, and KLF), and had improved abilities for proliferation, colony formation, network formation, and multiple-mesenchymal differentiation. We believe that this novel culturing method may further enhance regenerative therapies using hASCs.

PMC5587110,PMC5587110_000,"The International Space Station (ISS) National Laboratory is dedicated to studying the effects of space on life and physical systems, and to developing new science and technologies for space exploration. A key aspect of achieving these goals is to operate the ISS National Lab more like an Earth-based laboratory, conducting complex end-to-end experimentation, not limited to simple microgravity exposure. Towards that end NASA developed a novel suite of molecular biology laboratory tools, reagents, and methods, named WetLab-2, uniquely designed to operate in microgravity, and to process biological samples for real-time gene expression analysis on-orbit. This includes a novel fluidic RNA Sample Preparation Module and fluid transfer devices, all-in-one lyophilized PCR assays, centrifuge, and a real-time PCR thermal cycler."
PMC5587110,PMC5587110_001,"Here we describe the results from the WetLab-2 validation experiments conducted in microgravity during ISS increment 47/SPX-8. Specifically, quantitative PCR was performed on a concentration series of DNA calibration standards, and Reverse Transcriptase-quantitative PCR was conducted on RNA extracted and purified on-orbit from frozen Escherichia coli and mouse liver tissue. Cycle threshold (Ct) values and PCR efficiencies obtained on-orbit from DNA standards were similar to Earth (1 g) controls. Also, on-orbit multiplex analysis of gene expression from bacterial cells and mammalian tissue RNA samples was successfully conducted in about 3 h, with data transmitted within 2 h of experiment completion. Thermal cycling in microgravity resulted in the trapping of gas bubbles inside septa cap assay tubes, causing small but measurable increases in Ct curve noise and variability."
PMC5587110,PMC5587110_002,Bubble formation was successfully suppressed in a rapid follow-up on-orbit experiment using standard caps to pressurize PCR tubes and reduce gas release during heating cycles. The WetLab-2 facility now provides a novel operational on-orbit research capability for molecular biology and demonstrates the feasibility of more complex wet bench experiments in the ISS National Lab environment.
PMC8396460,PMC8396460_000,"Spaceflight causes cardiovascular changes due to microgravity-induced redistribution of body fluids and musculoskeletal unloading. Cardiac deconditioning and atrophy on Earth are associated with altered Trp53 and oxidative stress-related pathways, but the effects of spaceflight on cardiac changes at the molecular level are less understood. We tested the hypothesis that spaceflight alters the expression of key genes related to stress response pathways, which may contribute to cardiovascular deconditioning during extended spaceflight. Mice were exposed to spaceflight for 15 days or maintained on Earth (ground control). Ventricle tissue was harvested starting ~3 h post-landing. We measured expression of select genes implicated in oxidative stress pathways and Trp53 signaling by quantitative PCR. Cardiac expression levels of 37 of 168 genes tested were altered after spaceflight."
PMC8396460,PMC8396460_001,"Spaceflight downregulated transcription factor, Nfe2l2 (Nrf2) , upregulated Nox1 and downregulated Ptgs2 , suggesting a persistent increase in oxidative stress-related target genes. Spaceflight also substantially upregulated Cdkn1a ( p21 ) and cell cycle/apoptosis-related gene Myc , and downregulated the inflammatory response gene Tnf . There were no changes in apoptosis-related genes such as Trp53 . Spaceflight altered the expression of genes regulating redox balance, cell cycle and senescence in cardiac tissue of mice. Thus, spaceflight may contribute to cardiac dysfunction due to oxidative stress.

PMC5666799,PMC5666799_000,"Space radiation may pose a risk to skeletal health during subsequent aging. Irradiation acutely stimulates bone remodeling in mice, although the long-term influence of space radiation on bone-forming potential (osteoblastogenesis) and possible adaptive mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that ionizing radiation impairs osteoblastogenesis in an ion-type specific manner, with low doses capable of modulating expression of redox-related genes. 16-weeks old, male, C57BL6/J mice were exposed to low linear-energy-transfer (LET) protons (150 MeV/n) or high-LET 56 Fe ions (600 MeV/n) using either low (5 or 10 cGy) or high (50 or 200 cGy) doses at NASA’s Space Radiation Lab. Five weeks or one year after irradiation, tissues were harvested and analyzed by microcomputed tomography for cancellous microarchitecture and cortical geometry."
PMC5666799,PMC5666799_001,"Marrow-derived, adherent cells were grown under osteoblastogenic culture conditions. Cell lysates were analyzed by RT-PCR during the proliferative or mineralizing phase of growth, and differentiation was analyzed by imaging mineralized nodules. As expected, a high dose (200 cGy), but not lower doses, of either 56 Fe or protons caused a loss of cancellous bone volume/total volume. Marrow cells produced mineralized nodules ex vivo regardless of radiation type or dose; 56 Fe (200 cGy) inhibited osteoblastogenesis by more than 90% (5 weeks and 1 year post-IR). After 5 weeks, irradiation (protons or 56 Fe) caused few changes in gene expression levels during osteoblastogenesis, although a high dose 56 Fe (200 cGy) increased Catalase and Gadd45 ."
PMC5666799,PMC5666799_002,"The addition of exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD) protected marrow-derived osteoprogenitors from the damaging effects of exposure to low-LET ( 137 Cs γ) when irradiated in vitro, but had limited protective effects on high-LET 56 Fe-exposed cells. In sum, either protons or 56 Fe at a relatively high dose (200 cGy) caused persistent bone loss, whereas only high-LET 56 Fe increased redox-related gene expression, albeit to a limited extent, and inhibited osteoblastogenesis. Doses below 50 cGy did not elicit widespread responses in any parameter measured. We conclude that high-LET irradiation at 200 cGy impaired osteoblastogenesis and regulated steady-state gene expression of select redox-related genes during osteoblastogenesis, which may contribute to persistent bone loss.

PMC5460236,PMC5460236_000,"NASA’s Space Biology and Human Research Program entities have recently spearheaded communications both internally and externally to coordinate the agency’s translational research efforts. In this paper, we strongly advocate for translational research at NASA, provide recent examples of NASA sponsored early-stage translational research, and discuss options for a path forward. Our overall objective is to help in stimulating a collaborative research across multiple disciplines and entities that, working together, will more effectively and more rapidly achieve NASA’s goals for human spaceflight."
PMC6222041,PMC6222041_000,"One potentially important bone quality characteristic is the response of bone to cyclic (repetitive) mechanical loading. In small animals, such as in rats and mice, cyclic loading experiments are particularly challenging to perform in a precise manner due to the small size of the bones and difficult-to-eliminate machine compliance. Addressing this issue, we developed a precise method for ex vivo cyclic compressive loading of isolated mouse vertebral bodies. The method has three key characteristics: 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallel surfaces of the tiny vertebrae; pivotable loading platens to ensure uniform contact and loading of specimen surfaces; and specimen-specific micro-CT-based finite element analysis to measure stiffness to prescribe force levels that produce the same specified level of strain for all test specimens."
PMC6222041,PMC6222041_001,"To demonstrate utility, we measured fatigue life for three groups ( n = 5–6 per group) of L5 vertebrae of C57BL/6J male mice, comparing our new method against two methods commonly used in the literature. We found reduced scatter of the mechanical behavior for this new method compared to the literature methods. In particular, for a controlled level of strain, the standard deviation of the measured fatigue life was up to 5-fold lower for the new method (F-ratio = 4.9; p < 0.01). The improved precision for this new method for biomechanical testing of small-animal vertebrae may help elucidate aspects of bone quality.

PMC6813909,PMC6813909_000,"Bone can become brittle when exposed to ionizing radiation across a wide range of clinically relevant doses that span from radiotherapy (accumulative 50 Gy) to sterilization (~35,000 Gy). While irradiation-induced embrittlement has been attributed to changes in the collagen molecular structure, the relative role of collagen fragmentation versus non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking remains unclear. To better understand the effects of radiation on the bone material without cellular activity, we conducted an ex vivo x-ray radiation experiment on excised mouse lumbar vertebrae. Spinal tissue from twenty-week old, female, C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to a single x-ray radiation dose of either 0 (control), 50, 1,000, 17,000, or 35,000 Gy."
PMC6813909,PMC6813909_001,"Measurements were made for collagen fragmentation, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking, and both monotonic and cyclic-loading compressive mechanical properties. We found that the group differences for mechanical properties were more consistent with those for collagen fragmentation than for non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking. Monotonic strength at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy was lower than that of the control by 50% and 73% respectively, ( p < 0.001) but at 50 and 1,000 Gy was not different than the control. Consistent with those trends, collagen fragmentation only occurred at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy. By contrast, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking was greater than control for all radiation doses ( p < 0.001). All results were consistent both for monotonic and cyclic loading conditions."
PMC6813909,PMC6813909_002,"We conclude that the reductions in bone compressive monotonic strength and fatigue life due to ex vivo ionizing radiation are more likely caused by fragmentation of the collagen backbone than any increases in non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks.

PMC4095884,PMC4095884_000,"C2C12 myotube stretch caused a robust increase in P-p70S6K, but decreased P-FAK and P-ERK2. Neither Akt nor ERK1 were responsive to passive stretch. Similar but non-significant trends were observed in C57 primary cultures in response to stretch, and γ-SG -/- cultures displayed no p70S6K response. In contrast, in isolated muscles, p70S6K was mechanically responsive. Basal p70S6K activation was elevated in muscles of γ-SG -/- mice, in a calcium-independent manner. p70S6K activation increased with stretch in both C57 and γ-SG -/- isolated muscles, and was sustained in γ-SG -/- muscles, unlike the transient response in C57 muscles. Rapamycin treatment blocked all of p70S6K activation in stretched C57 muscles, and reduced downstream S6RP phosphorylation. However, even though rapamycin treatment decreased p70S6K activation in stretched γ-SG -/- muscles, S6RP phosphorylation remained elevated."
PMC4095884,PMC4095884_001,"p70S6K is an important component of γ-sarcoglycan-dependent mechanotransduction in skeletal muscle. Our results suggest that loss of γ-sarcoglycan uncouples the response of p70S6K to stretch and implies that γ-sarcoglycan is important for inactivation of this pathway. Overall, we assert that altered load-sensing mechanisms exist in muscular dystrophies where the sarcoglycans are absent.

PMC3040128,PMC3040128_000,"Here we report that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c play important roles in pollen development, germination and tube elongation. AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants have no obvious morphological changes compared with wild-type plants across a variety of growth conditions. An AtrabD2b/2c double mutant is also indistinguishable from wild-type plants during vegetative growth; however its siliques are shorter than those in wild-type plants. Compared with wild-type plants, AtrabD2b/2c mutants produce deformed pollen with swollen and branched pollen tube tips. The shorter siliques in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant were found to be primarily due to the pollen defects. AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have different but overlapping expression patterns, and they are both highly expressed in pollen. Both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c protein localize to Golgi bodies."
PMC3040128,PMC3040128_001,These findings support a partially redundant role for AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c in vesicle trafficking during pollen tube growth that cannot be fulfilled by the remaining AtRabD family members.
PMC3177255,PMC3177255_000,"The Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor SYP41 is involved in vesicle fusion at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and interacts with AtVPS45, SYP61, and VTI12. These proteins are involved in diverse cellular processes, including vacuole biogenesis and stress tolerance. A previously uncharacterized protein, named TNO1 (for TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), was identified by coimmunoprecipitation as a SYP41-interacting protein. TNO1 was found to localize to the TGN by immunofluorescence microscopy. A tno1 mutant showed increased sensitivity to high concentrations of NaCl, KCl, and LiCl and also to mannitol-induced osmotic stress. Localization of SYP61, which is involved in the salt stress response, was disrupted in the tno1 mutant."
PMC3177255,PMC3177255_001,"Vacuolar proteins were partially secreted to the apoplast in the tno1 mutant, suggesting that TNO1 is required for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole. The tno1 mutant had delayed formation of the brefeldin A (BFA) compartment in cotyledons upon application of BFA, suggesting less efficient membrane fusion processes in the mutant. Unlike most TGN proteins, TNO1 does not relocate to the BFA compartment upon BFA treatment. These data demonstrate that TNO1 is involved in vacuolar trafficking and salt tolerance, potentially via roles in vesicle fusion and in maintaining TGN structure or identity. The plant vacuole is a versatile organelle that has important functions, including maintaining turgor, ion homeostasis, compartmentalizing toxic material, accumulating defense compounds, and storing and degrading proteins ( Marty, 1999 )."
PMC3177255,PMC3177255_002,"To maintain these functions, correct transport of vacuolar proteins is required. Vacuolar proteins are synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are transported cotranslationally into the ER lumen. From the ER, they are transported to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) via the Golgi ( Törmäkangas et al., 2001 ). In the TGN, vacuolar proteins with sequence-specific vacuolar sorting determinants are thought to be recognized by vacuolar sorting receptors (VSRs; Kirsch et al., 1994 ; Ahmed et al., 2000 ; daSilva et al., 2005 ), although a recent report has suggested that recognition of cargo by VSRs may occur as early as the ER ( Niemes et al., 2010 ). Storage proteins with C-terminal sorting sequences are also bound by VSRs or by a second putative sorting receptor, RMR1 ( Jiang et al., 2000 ; Shimada et al., 2003a ; Park et al., 2005 , 2007 ; Hinz et al., 2007 )."
PMC3177255,PMC3177255_003,"After the receptors recognize their cargo, vacuolar proteins are transported to the prevacuolar compartment (PVC; Sanderfoot et al., 1998 ; Happel et al., 2004 ; Song et al., 2006 ) before transport on to the vacuole. In mammalian cells, cargo receptors are recycled from their destination to the site of cargo binding ( Seaman, 2005 ). VSR1 was found to localize to the TGN and the PVC ( Paris et al., 1997 ; Sanderfoot et al., 1998 ); thus, VSR1 was also suggested to cycle between these organelles. Soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) are integral membrane proteins required for the fusion of vesicles with their target membrane. SNAREs can be classified based on their site of function: v (vesicle)-SNAREs are localized to the vesicle membrane, and t (target)-SNAREs are localized to the target membrane ( Rothman, 1994 ; Søgaard et al., 1994 )."
PMC3177255,PMC3177255_004,"Generally, one v-SNARE on the vesicle and three t-SNAREs on the target membrane form a trans-SNARE complex, bringing the two membranes in contact and driving membrane fusion ( McNew et al., 2000 ). Clathrin-coated vesicles containing VSR1 contain the v-SNARE VTI11, which forms a SNARE complex with SYP5, SYP2, and VAMP727 at the PVC during anterograde trafficking from the TGN ( Kirsch et al., 1994 ; Sanderfoot et al., 2001a ; Ebine et al., 2008 ). However, the mechanism of recycling of VSR1 from the PVC to the TGN is not yet fully understood. A complex containing the SNAREs SYP41, SYP61, and VTI12 and the Sec1/Munc18-like protein AtVPS45, a potential regulator of vesicle fusion ( Dulubova et al., 2002 ; Bryant and James, 2003 ), is found at the TGN in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ; Bassham and Raikhel, 1998 ; Bassham et al., 2000 )."
PMC3177255,PMC3177255_005,"SNAREs in the SYP41 complex, along with another SNARE, YKT61/62, were found to be sufficient for vesicle fusion in vitro ( Chen et al., 2005 ). Recently, AtVPS45 was suggested to be involved in the recycling of VSR1, as RNA interference knockdown of AtVPS45 expression causes mislocalization of VSR1 ( Zouhar et al., 2009 ). SYP41 and SYP42 are highly homologous t-SNAREs with 62% amino acid sequence identity. However, they form separate complexes with AtVPS45 in different subdomains of the TGN ( Bassham et al., 2000 ) and are not functionally redundant, as individual syp41 and syp42 knockout mutants are gametophytic lethal ( Sanderfoot et al., 2001b ). A mutation in SYP61, another t-SNARE in the SYP41 complex ( Zhu et al., 2002 ), caused defects in osmotic stress tolerance and abscisic acid regulation of stomatal responses."
PMC3177255,PMC3177255_006,"The v-SNARE VTI12 is involved in trafficking of storage proteins ( Sanmartín et al., 2007 ) and a vti12 mutant showed an early-senescence phenotype under starvation conditions, suggesting that VTI12 is also involved in the autophagy pathway for the degradation of cellular contents ( Surpin et al., 2003 ). In addition to their function together in vesicle fusion, components of the SYP41 complex therefore also appear to be involved in distinct processes, suggesting that they may function in additional SNARE complexes. In this study, we identified a novel SYP41-interacting protein that we named TNO1 (for TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein). TNO1 is a membrane protein at the TGN and is required for efficient vacuolar trafficking, consistent with the hypothesis that it functions together with the SYP41 SNARE complex."
PMC3177255,PMC3177255_007,"A tno1 knockout mutant has a salt and osmotic stress-sensitive phenotype, possibly due to the partial mislocalization of SYP61. A brefeldin A (BFA)-treated tno1 mutant showed a delay in formation of the BFA compartment, indicating that TNO1 could be important in TGN/endosome fusion events. We propose that TNO1 is involved in vacuolar trafficking and salt stress resistance by facilitating the vesicle fusion process."
PMC11500582,PMC11500582_000,"SNAREs play an important role in the process of membrane trafficking. In the present research, we investigated subcellular localization of an uncharacterized Arabidopsis thaliana protein reported to interact with a trans -Golgi network-localized Qa-SNARE, SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS 43. Based on the similarity of its amino acid sequence to metazoan fucosyltransferases, we have named this novel protein AtGTLP ( Arabidopsis thaliana G lycosyl T ransferase- L ike P rotein) and predicted that it should be a member of yet uncharacterized family of Arabidopsis fucosyltransferases, as it shows no significant sequence similarity to fucosyltransferases previously identified in Arabidopsis. AtGTLP is a membrane-anchored protein, which exhibits a type II-like topology, with a single transmembrane helix and a globular domain in the C-terminal part of its amino acid sequence."

PMC5387210,PMC5387210_000,"We found that Arabidopsis thaliana TNO1 (TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), a putative tethering factor localized at the trans -Golgi network, affects root skewing. tno1 knockout mutants display enhanced root skewing and epidermal cell file rotation. Skewing of tno1 roots increases upon microtubule stabilization, but is insensitive to microtubule destabilization. Microtubule destabilization leads to severe defects in cell morphology in tno1 seedlings. Microtubule array orientation is unaffected in the mutant roots, suggesting that the increase in cell file rotation is independent of the orientation of microtubule arrays. We conclude that TNO1 modulates root skewing in a mechanism that is dependent on microtubules but is not linked to disruption of the orientation of microtubule arrays."

PMC4642138,PMC4642138_000,"The trans -Golgi network (TGN) is a dynamic organelle that functions as a relay station for receiving endocytosed cargo, directing secretory cargo, and trafficking to the vacuole. TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein (TNO1) is a large, TGN-localized, coiled-coil protein that associates with the membrane fusion protein SYP41, a target SNARE, and is required for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole. Here, we show that a tno1 mutant has auxin transport-related defects. Mutant roots have delayed lateral root emergence, decreased gravitropic bending of plant organs and increased sensitivity to the auxin analog 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and the natural auxin 3-indoleacetic acid. Auxin asymmetry at the tips of elongating stage II lateral roots was reduced in the tno1 mutant, suggesting a role for TNO1 in cellular auxin transport during lateral root emergence."

PMC2915878,PMC2915878_000,"Maintaining the proximity of centrosomes to nuclei is important in several cellular contexts, and LINC complexes formed by SUN and KASH proteins are crucial in this process. Here, we characterize the presumed Drosophila ortholog of the mammalian SUN protein, sperm-associated antigen 4 (Spag4, previously named Giacomo), and demonstrate that Spag4 is required for centriole and nuclear attachment during spermatogenesis. Production of spag4 mRNA is limited to the testis, and Spag4 protein shows a dynamic pattern of association with the germline nuclei, including a concentration of protein at the site of attachment of the single spermatid centriole. In the absence of Spag4, nuclei and centrioles or basal bodies (BBs) dissociate from each other after meiosis."
PMC2915878,PMC2915878_001,"This role of Spag4 in centriolar attachment does not involve either of the two KASH proteins of the Drosophila genome (Klarsicht and MSP-300), but does require the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin. Yuri shows an identical pattern of localization at the nuclear surface to Spag4 during spermatogenesis, and epistasis studies show that the activities of Yuri and dynein-dynactin are downstream of spag4 in this centriole attachment pathway. The later defects in spermatogenesis seen for yuri and spag4 mutants are similar, suggesting they could be secondary to initial disruption of events at the nuclear surface.

PMC3901686,PMC3901686_000,"Space travel presents unlimited opportunities for exploration and discovery, but requires better understanding of the biological consequences of long-term exposure to spaceflight. Immune function in particular is relevant for space travel. Human immune responses are weakened in space, with increased vulnerability to opportunistic infections and immune-related conditions. In addition, microorganisms can become more virulent in space, causing further challenges to health. To understand these issues better and to contribute to design of effective countermeasures, we used the Drosophila model of innate immunity to study immune responses in both hypergravity and spaceflight."
PMC3901686,PMC3901686_001,"Focusing on infections mediated through the conserved Toll and Imd signaling pathways, we found that hypergravity improves resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infections except in a known gravitaxis mutant of the yuri gagarin gene. These results led to the first spaceflight project on Drosophila immunity, in which flies that developed to adulthood in microgravity were assessed for immune responses by transcription profiling on return to Earth. Spaceflight alone altered transcription, producing activation of the heat shock stress system. Space flies subsequently infected by fungus failed to activate the Toll pathway. In contrast, bacterial infection produced normal activation of the Imd pathway. We speculate on possible linkage between functional Toll signaling and the heat shock chaperone system."

PMC6387434,PMC6387434_000,"Space radiation has recently been considered a risk factor for astronauts’ cardiac health. As an example, for the case of how to query and identify datasets within NASA’s GeneLab database and demonstrate the database utility, we used an unbiased systems biology method for identifying key genes/drivers for the contribution of space radiation on the cardiovascular system. This knowledge can contribute to designing appropriate experiments targeting these specific pathways. Microarray data from cardiomyocytes of male C57BL/6 mice followed-up for 28 days after exposure to 900 mGy of 1 GeV proton or 150 mGy of 1 GeV/n 56 Fe were compared to human endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured for 7 days on the International Space Station (ISS). We observed common molecular pathways between simulated space radiation and HUVECs flown on the ISS."
PMC6387434,PMC6387434_001,"The analysis suggests FYN is the central driver/hub for the cardiovascular response to space radiation: the known oxidative stress induced immediately following radiation would only be transient and would upregulate FYN , which in turn would reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, protecting the cardiovascular system. The transcriptomic signature of exposure to protons was also much closer to the spaceflight signature than 56 Fe’s signature. To our knowledge, this is the first time GeneLab datasets were utilized to provide potential biological indications that the majority of ions on the ISS are protons, clearly illustrating the power of omics analysis. More generally, this work also demonstrates how to combine animal radiation studies done on the ground and spaceflight studies to evaluate human risk in space."

In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of S. marcescens did not persist after the bacterial cultures were passaged on the ground."

Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later timepoints spaceflight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls in vitro, and in the host. These results suggest complex physiological changes occurring in pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need to be characterized."

Drosophila can be sent to space in large numbers to examine the effects of microgravity on heart structure and function, which is fundamentally conserved from flies to humans. Flies reared in microgravity exhibit cardiac constriction with myofibrillar remodeling and diminished output. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in isolated hearts revealed reduced expression of sarcomeric/extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and dramatically increased proteasomal gene expression, consistent with the observed compromised, smaller hearts and suggesting abnormal proteostasis. This was examined further on a second flight in which we found dramatically elevated proteasome aggregates co-localizing with increased amyloid and polyQ deposits."

PMC8716943,PMC8716943_000,"Primary root growth is required by the plant to anchor in the soil and reach out for nutrients and water, while dealing with obstacles. Efficient root elongation and bending depends upon the coordinated action of environmental sensing, signal transduction, and growth responses. The actin cytoskeleton is a highly plastic network that constitutes a point of integration for environmental stimuli and hormonal pathways. In this review, we present a detailed compilation highlighting the importance of the actin cytoskeleton during primary root growth and we describe how actin-binding proteins, plant hormones, and actin-disrupting drugs affect root growth and root actin. We also discuss the feedback loop between actin and root responses to light and gravity. Actin affects cell division and elongation through the control of its own organization."
PMC8716943,PMC8716943_001,"We remark upon the importance of longitudinally oriented actin bundles as a hallmark of cell elongation as well as the role of the actin cytoskeleton in protein trafficking and vacuolar reshaping during this process. The actin network is shaped by a plethora of actin-binding proteins; however, there is still a large gap in connecting the molecular function of these proteins with their developmental effects. Here, we summarize their function and known effects on primary root growth with a focus on their high level of specialization. Light and gravity are key factors that help us understand root growth directionality. The response of the root to gravity relies on hormonal, particularly auxin, homeostasis, and the actin cytoskeleton."
PMC8716943,PMC8716943_002,"Actin is necessary for the perception of the gravity stimulus via the repositioning of sedimenting statoliths, but it is also involved in mediating the growth response via the trafficking of auxin transporters and cell elongation. Furthermore, auxin and auxin analogs can affect the composition of the actin network, indicating a potential feedback loop. Light, in its turn, affects actin organization and hence, root growth, although its precise role remains largely unknown. Recently, fundamental studies with the latest techniques have given us more in-depth knowledge of the role and organization of actin in the coordination of root growth; however, there remains a lot to discover, especially in how actin organization helps cell shaping, and therefore root growth."
PMC8716943,PMC8716943_003,"Keywords: actin, root growth, cell elongation, auxin, gravitropism, actin-binding protein, light The actin network has been studied for a long time and there is a relatively large body of earlier work on the role of actin in regulating root growth.

Although this sometimes led to contradictory or incomplete findings, the actin network is essential for root growth by regulating cell elongation and division. A main conclusion is that actin organization is developmentally regulated in the growing root tip. Bundled and longitudinally oriented actin filaments are a hallmark of cell elongation."
PMC8716943,PMC8716943_004,"Failure to achieve this arrangement by tampering with hormonal homeostasis or altering actin-binding protein function results in root growth defects. Most results with hormone and drug treatments and actin-binding protein mutants seem to correlate well with this general principle. These changes in actin organization affect cell growth in different ways, and of particular interest for further study is how actin-mediated delivery of cell wall modifying components aids cell elongation of the primary root meristem. There are also causal links between actin, vacuolar morphology, and cell elongation. However, more evidence is needed to show that defects in actin directly cause defects in vacuolar morphology that subsequently cause root growth defects."

In general, actin-binding proteins are well studied, however, with respect to root growth, there is little data available on phenotypic effects, usually due to a high degree of genetic redundancy. Overexpression often leads to detrimental effects on root growth, while single or even double mutants do not. With recent advances in CRISPR multiplexing, this redundancy problem can be tackled efficiently and the roles of actin-binding proteins in root growth and development can and should be elucidated. Hormonal regulation of primary root growth occurs mainly through the coordination between auxin and cytokinin signaling, which contributes to the generation of developmental regions with a specific actin organization."
PMC8716943,PMC8716943_006,"The role of auxins, cytokinins, and especially other hormones in the control of the actin cytoskeleton requires more future work. This work would be made easier by the consistent and more precise denomination of which root zones and cell layers are analyzed, in order to compare the effects of individual hormones and their combination in the control of the actin network. Related to this is the study of root gravitropism, where actin has several different functions. It is involved in the direct sensing of gravity, controls the propagation of the hormone signal and it is likely involved in the subsequent regulation of cell elongation. This study brings together three different roles for actin and is therefore a very interesting subfield, which will benefit by recent advances in live imaging."
PMC8716943,PMC8716943_007,"With vertically oriented confocal laser scanning microscopes it is possible to study root gravitropism in vivo in real time and see details and subtleties not imaged before. Another new way of studying actin will be to use new optogenetic tools that allow the direct manipulation of the cytoskeleton or cytoskeletal components ( Zhang et al., 2021 ), which might provide a deeper understanding of how actin functions in regulating cell elongation in complex tissues such as the root. With these new possibilities it will be possible to subtly disturb the actin network while imaging it at the highest temporal and spatial resolution."

Here, we identified and characterized the HYPERSENSITIVE TO LATRUNCULIN B1 (HLB1) protein isolated through a forward-genetic screen in Arabidopsis thaliana for mutants with heightened sensitivity to actin-disrupting drugs. HLB1 is a plant-specific tetratricopeptide repeat domain-containing protein of unknown function encoded by a single Arabidopsis gene. HLB1 associated with the trans -Golgi network ( TGN )/early endosome ( EE ) and tracked along filamentous actin, indicating that it could link post-Golgi traffic with the actin cytoskeleton in plants."

The min7/ben1 mutant phenocopied the mild root developmental defects and latrunculin B hypersensitivity of hlb1 , and analyses of a hlb1/ min7/ben1 double mutant showed that hlb1 and min7/ben1 operate in common genetic pathways. Based on these data, we propose that HLB1 together with MIN7/BEN1 form a complex with actin to modulate the function of the TGN / EE at the intersection of the exocytic and endocytic pathways in plants."

Root hairs are single-cell cylindrical projections that expand the effective radius of the root. In doing so, they play crucial roles in the uptake of water and nutrients from the soil, especially under conditions in which such resources are limiting ( Carminati et al., 2017 )."
PMC6048781,PMC6048781_001,"Root hairs expand by tip growth, a process that involves the targeted delivery and secretion of vesicles to the cell apex. As a result, root hairs attain lengths that are several times their widths ( Chebli et al., 2013 ). In tip-growing cells, cargo transported by tip-targeted vesicles consist of an assortment of carbohydrate precursors that are needed for the assembly and remodeling of the apical cell wall ( Gu and Nielsen, 2013 ). Research spanning several decades has led to the identification of multiple components of the tip growth machinery including protein modulators of cytoskeletal organization, membrane trafficking, cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca 2+ ] cyt ) signaling, and phosphoinositide metabolism ( Cole and Fowler, 2006 ; Rounds and Bezanilla, 2013 )."
PMC6048781,PMC6048781_002,"In recent years, plant malectin-like receptor kinases, also known as Catharanthus roseus receptor-like kinases (CrRLK1Ls; Franck et al., 2018 ), have been shown to regulate tip growth in root hairs and pollen tubes ( Duan et al., 2010 ; Bai et al., 2014 ; Haruta et al., 2014 ; Ge et al., 2017 ; Schoenaers et al., 2018 ). In one noteworthy study, Bai et al. (2014) reported that a CrRLK1L, which they named [Ca 2+ ] cyt -associated protein kinase 1 (CAP1), modulates root hair growth by maintaining ammonium (NH 4 + ) homeostasis. CAP1 is also known as ERULUS (ERU), named after the son of FERONIA (FER), a widely studied member of the CrRLK1L family ( Haruta et al., 2014 )."
PMC6048781,PMC6048781_003,"In Arabidopsis thaliana , cap1/eru loss-of-function mutants have short and irregularly shaped root hairs consistent with a role of CAP1/ERU as a positive regulator of root hair growth ( Bai et al., 2014 ; Haruta et al., 2014 ; Schoenaers et al., 2018 ). Bai et al. (2014) proposed a model wherein CAP1/ERU functions in maintaining root hair growth under high NH 4 + environments by sensing cytoplasmic NH 4 + . Sensing of cytoplasmic NH 4 + by CAP1/ERU then triggers signaling events that lead to NH 4 + sequestration into the vacuole, making it less toxic to the cell. The model postulates that toxic levels of NH 4 + accumulate in the cytoplasm of cap1/eru loss-of-function mutants, resulting in the disappearance of tip-focused [Ca 2+ ] cyt gradients, and because of this lack of tip-focused [Ca 2+ ] cyt gradients, their root hairs cease to expand ( Bai et al., 2014 )."
PMC6048781,PMC6048781_004,"In this letter, we question the proposed role of CAP1/ERU in NH 4 + homeostasis based on our studies of a new eru-3 mutant allele, showing that CAP1/ERU is instead localized to the plasma membrane (PM) and its function is linked to tip-focused [Ca 2+ ] cyt oscillations. This is further supported by recent work on the eru-2 mutant by Schoenaers et al. (2018) , as described below. A major result used to support the CAP1/ERU-NH 4 + homeostasis model was the observation that a CAP1/ERU-GFP fusion localized to the tonoplast. According to the model, the tonoplast-localized CAP1/ERU is what senses cytoplasmic NH 4 + , resulting in its compartmentalization into the vacuole ( Bai et al., 2014 )."

The cap1 mutant (SALK_083442) studied by Bai et al. (2014) is similar to eru-2 ; therefore, we refer to it here as cap1/eru-2 ( Figure 1A ). When we expressed an ERU-GFP construct under the control of the constitutive UBIQUITIN10 ( UBQ10 ) promoter ( UBQ10:ERU-GFP ) in the eru-3 mutants, their root hairs were restored to wild-type lengths, indicating that the fusion protein was functional ( Figures 1B and 1C )."

PMC6048781,PMC6048781_008,"Distal to the root hair tip, ERU-GFP decorated distinct and dynamic puncta that were reminiscent of post-Golgi and endocytic vesicles ( Figure 1D ). As root hairs matured and ceased growth, the intensity of ERU-GFP at the tip declined ( Figure 1D ). Time-course and correlation analyses revealed that tip-directed accumulation of ERU-GFP was most intense in root hairs that grew rapidly ( Figures 1E and 1F ), supporting the role of ERU as a positive regulator of root hair tip growth. It is important to note that Bai et al. (2014) used transient expression of a CAP1/ERU-GFP fusion in protoplasts and onion epidermal cells to conclude that it localized to the tonoplast, and the functionality of their CAP1/ERU-GFP construct was not validated in root hairs."
PMC6048781,PMC6048781_009,"It is possible that their CAP1/ERU-GFP was mislocalized because it was expressed in cell types (i.e., leaf protoplasts and onion epidermal cells) in which ERU is not typically found. We attempted to express ERU-GFP in the eru-3 mutant under the control of the native ERU promoter ( ERU pro ) consisting of 626 bp upstream of the ERU gene. Unfortunately, we were unable to recover ERU pro :ERU-GFP lines. However, it was recently reported that a 2529-bp sequence that included the ERU promoter coupled to the ERU coding and GFP sequence ( ERUp:ERU-GFP ) complemented cap1/eru-2 root hairs ( Schoenaers et al., 2018 ). This group found that expressed ERU-GFP localized to root hairs in a similar manner as our constitutively expressed ERU-GFP, further supporting our conclusion that the PM is where the ERU protein resides. Another major result of Bai et al."
PMC6048781,PMC6048781_010,"(2014) that we address in this letter is their finding that root hairs of cap1/eru loss-of-function mutants appeared to lack tip-focused [Ca 2+ ] cyt gradients. We feel that it is important to address these results because they provide an example of how [Ca 2+ ] cyt imaging data on root hairs can be misinterpreted. For these experiments, it is critical to note that root hair growth ceases when the large central vacuole protrudes toward the cell apex ( Grierson et al., 2014 ). Furthermore, mature, nongrowing root hairs in which the vacuole protrudes to the apex have been shown to lack [Ca 2+ ] cyt gradients ( Wymer et al., 1997 ). The images of cap1/eru-2 root hairs that Bai et al. (2014) presented as the basis for extracting their [Ca 2+ ] cyt data (Figures 2A and 3C in Bai et al. [2014] ) clearly showed the vacuole protruding to the apex."
PMC6048781,PMC6048781_011,"Based on the above observations, we would not expect to find [Ca 2+ ] cyt gradients in such root hairs. We expressed the intensiometric [Ca 2+ ] cyt reporter G-CAMP3 ( Tian et al., 2009 ) in eru-3 to assess if their root hairs lacked a [Ca 2+ ] cyt gradient. We were careful to sample [Ca 2+ ] cyt only in root hairs that had a dense cytoplasm at the cell apex. In contrast to the results of Bai et al. (2014) , we found that eru-3 root hairs that still had a substantial cytoplasm at the apex did not lack tip-focused [Ca 2+ ] cyt gradients. These eru-3 root hairs were still elongating, albeit at a significantly reduced rate when compared with the wild type (∼0.20 μm/min for eru-3 versus 1 μm/min for the wild type). However, we did observe that patterns of tip [Ca 2+ ] cyt oscillations in these slow growing eru-3 root hairs were compromised."
PMC6048781,PMC6048781_012,"Compared with the wild type, root hairs of eru-3 had more prolonged periods of elevated tip-focused [Ca 2+ ] cyt followed by longer periods of dampened [Ca 2+ ] cyt ( Figures 2A to 2C ; Supplemental Movie 1 ). Quantitative analysis of [Ca 2+ ] cyt following the fast Fourier transform methods described by Schoenaers et al. (2018) showed that eru-3 displayed low frequency [Ca 2+ ] cyt oscillations. The main frequency of [Ca 2+ ] cyt oscillations in eru-3 root hairs was 0.003 ± 0.0002 Hz compared with 0.044 ± 0.0184 Hz in the wild type ( Figure 2D ). Furthermore, the amplitude of [Ca 2+ ] cyt oscillation at the tips of eru-3 was ∼3-fold higher than the wild type ( Figure 2E ). These results are in agreement with findings of Schoenaers et al.

PMC8364238,PMC8364238_000,"Root hairs are single-cell protrusions that enable roots to optimize nutrient and water acquisition. These structures attain their tubular shapes by confining growth to the cell apex, a process called tip growth.

Here, we show that SPIRRIG (SPI), a beige and Chediak Higashi domain-containing protein involved in membrane trafficking, and BRK1 and SCAR2, subunits of the WAVE/SCAR (W/SC) actin nucleating promoting complex, display polarized localizations in Arabidopsis thaliana root hairs during distinct developmental stages.

PMC2998437,PMC2998437_000,"While the bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is the best studied biological mechanosensor and serves as a paradigm for how a protein can sense and respond to membrane tension, the simple matter of its oligomeric state has led to debate, with models ranging from tetramers to hexamers. Indeed, two different oligomeric states of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL have been resolved by X-ray crystallography: The M. tuberculosis channel (MtMscL) is a pentamer, while the S. aureus protein (SaMscL) forms a tetramer. Because several studies suggest that, like MtMscL, the E. coli MscL (EcoMscL) is a pentamer, we re-investigated the oligomeric state of SaMscL. To determine the structural organization of MscL in the cell membrane we developed a disulfide-trapping approach."
PMC2998437,PMC2998437_001,"Surprisingly, we found that virtually all SaMscL channels in vivo are pentameric, indicating this as the physiologically relevant and functional oligomeric state. Complementing our in vivo results, we purified SaMscL and assessed its oligomeric state using three independent approaches (sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation, crosslinking, and light scattering) and established that SaMscL is a pentamer when solubilized in Triton X-100 and C 8 E 5 detergents. However, performing similar experiments on SaMscL solubilized in LDAO, the detergent used in the crystallographic study, confirmed the tetrameric oligomerization resolved by X-ray crystallography. We further demonstrate that this stoichiometric shift is reversible by conventional detergent exchange experiments. Our results firmly establish the pentameric organization of SaMscL in vivo."
PMC2998437,PMC2998437_002,"Furthermore they demonstrate that detergents can alter the subunit stoichiometry of membrane protein complexes in vitro; thus, in vivo assays are necessary to firmly establish a membrane protein's true functionally relevant oligomeric state. With multiple oligomeric states identified in vitro, we devised a disulfide-trapping strategy to identify the oligomeric state of MscL in bacterial membranes. Using this approach, we were able to directly measure the subunit stoichiometry of SaMscL in vivo by generating a series of double-cysteine mutants in regions predicted to be in close proximity from both existing crystal structures ( Figure 1A ).

As we previously observed [9] , osmotic shock increased disulfide bridging, presumably because reductants including glutathione and thioredoxin are released from the cell [11] , thus decreasing the reducing potential of the cytosol. The protein content of the lysed cells was evaluated using SDS-PAGE and molecular weight standards. For the L10C/L89C or L10C/M91C SaMscL channels, we were able to observe efficient in vivo disulfide trapping ( Figure 1B ). For the L10C/L89C protein, a range of oligomeric states was observed, a pentamer being the maximal state. However, for the L10C/M91C protein, one primary band was observed that reflects a pentameric complex."
PMC2998437,PMC2998437_004,"These data demonstrate that the pentamer is by far the major species within the cell membrane and thus appears to be the true structural and functional unit in vivo. The ability to detect mechanical forces is at the basis of not only the senses of touch hearing and balance but also cardiovascular and osmotic regulation. One of the primary ways that organisms detect forces is through mechanosensitive channels, and mechanosensation is so vital that essentially all organisms have at least one such sensor. Indeed, the best-studied mechanosensitive channel is from bacteria, and because relatively little is known of mechanosensors from higher organisms, these channels are a model for how a protein can sense and respond to mechanical forces. Although the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL has been well studied, the simple issue of how many subunits it has is hotly debated."
PMC2998437,PMC2998437_005,There are even two published crystal structures showing either tetrameric or pentameric complexes. Here we show that the channel is actually pentameric in vivo and that the detergent used to solubilize the protein can rearrange the complexes from pentamers to tetramers.

One can even change the modality of the sensor. Briefly, the introduction of charges into the MscL pore lumen gates the channel in the absence of membrane tension; thus, by inserting compounds that acquire a charge on exposure to an alternative stimulus, such as light or pH, into the pore of the channel, controllable nanoswitches that detect these alternative modalities have been engineered."

In this study, we used in vivo and electrophysiological approaches to demonstrate that the introduction of a charge into pore lumen of MscL does indeed influence the permeation of charged molecules. These effects were more drastic for larger compounds and, surprisingly, were related to the orientation of the MscL channel in the membrane.—Yang, L-M, Blount, P.

A MscL homologue from Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been resolved by X-ray crystallography and shown to be of simple architecture: a homopentamer, with each subunit containing 2 transmembrane α helices and a cytoplasmic α helical bundle ( 3 )."

Several previous studies have recognized that this channel has many properties that would make it ideal for use in vesicular-based targeted drug-release nanodevices. It has a very large pore size (30–40 Å; ref. 8 ); thus, when gated, the nanopore would allow large compounds to be released.

To perform this technique, compounds that acquire charges in response to these stimuli are inserted chemically, by thiol reactions to unique cysteines substituted by site-directed mutagenesis, into the pore of the channel. However, a charge in the pore lumen might not only encourage actuation of the nanopore but also influence the permeation of charged molecules. In this study, we used in vivo efflux assays and patch-clamp approaches to address this question. It has been assumed that, because of its large pore size, MscL has no ionic preference."
PMC3005423,PMC3005423_005,"Therefore, for this study, we initially sought to determine whether this was indeed the case. We recorded from inside-out patches obtained from giant bacterial spheroplasts, as described previously ( 21 ). Using asymmetric conditions, as described in Materials and Methods, the I / V plot of wild-type MscL was generated, and its reversal potential was determined. Figure 1 shows that wild-type MscL has a positive reversal potential of 0.57 ± 0.09 mV. This finding is much closer to the Cl − reversal potential (17.5 mV) than the reversal potential for K + (−27.8 mV), thus indicating an anionic preference."

It is one of the best studied mechanosensitive channels and serves as a paradigm for how a protein can sense and respond to membrane tension. Two MscL crystal structures of the orthologs M. tuberculosis and S. aureus have been solved showing pentameric and tetrameric structures, respectively. Several studies followed to understand whether the discrepancy in their stoichiometry was a species difference or a consequence of the protein manipulation for crystallization. Two independent studies now agree that the full-length S. aureus MscL is actually a pentamer, not tetramer. While detergents appear to play a role in modifying the oligomeric state of the protein, a cytoplasmic helical bundle has also been implicated."

We find that the oligomeric state of S. aureus MscLs with different C-terminal truncations, including the one used to obtain the tetrameric S. aureus MscL crystal structure, are pentamers in vivo . Thus, the C-terminal domain of the S. aureus protein only plays a critical role in the oligomeric state of the SaMscL protein when it is solubilized in detergent.

It is one of the best characterized mechanosensors known, thus serving as a paradigm of how such molecules sense and respond to stimuli. In addition, the fact that it can be genetically modified, expressed, isolated, and manipulated has led to its proposed use as a triggered nanovalve for various functions including sensors within microelectronic array chips, as well as vesicular-based targeted drug release. X-ray crystallography reveals a homo-pentameric complex with each subunit containing two transmembrane α-helices (TM1 and TM2) and a single carboxyl terminal α-helix arranging within the complex to form a five-fold cytoplasmic bundle (CB), whose function and stability remain unclear."
PMC3289768,PMC3289768_001,"In this study, we show three routes that throttle the open channel conductance. When the linker between the TM2 and CB domain is shortened by deletions or constrained by either cross linking or heavy metal coordination, the conductance of the channel is reduced; in later two cases, even reversibly. While having implications for the stability of the CB, these data also provide routes for engineering MscL sensors that are more versatile for potential nanotech devices. Keywords: Osmoregulation, Conductance, Nanopore, Biosensor, Drug-release device The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, MscL, is a bacterial channel located in the cytoplasmic membrane that protects cells from lysis upon acute decrease in external osmotic environment by releasing cytoplasmic osmolytes. 1 This channel was first identified in E. coli , and most functional studies have been undertaken in this species."
PMC3289768,PMC3289768_002,"A MscL homologue from Mycobacterium tuberculosis , which has 67% similarity, has been resolved by X-ray crystallography and shown to be a homopentamer, with each subunit containing two transmembrane α helices (TM1 and TM2), of which TM1 forms the pore of the channel and TM2 is exposed to the lipid bilayer. 2 Although a more recent crystal structure of MscL from S. aureus shows a tetrameric complex, 3 this appears to be a detergent-specific oligomeric organization not reflecting a physiological state; in vivo essentially all channels are pentameric. 4 – 5 The pentameric channel opens by the expansion of both TM1 and TM2 in response to tension in cell membrane. 6 – 11 The channel also contains a single carboxyl terminal α helix from each subunit that together assemble into a 5-helix cytoplasmic bundle (CB)."
PMC3289768,PMC3289768_003,"2 It remains unclear what the function of the CB is, and whether or to what extent the bundle is dissociated during channel gating. Previous studies have shown that the E. coli MscL channel has a very large pore size, greater than 30Å, 12 which has caused some researchers to speculate that it could be used in nanodevices. Indeed, it has many properties that would make it ideal for use as a triggered nanovalve in such devices. It can be translated in vitro 13 or synthetically synthesized, reconstituted into lipids, and yet spontaneously assemble into a functional complex. 14 Since introduction of charges into the channel pore lumen can gate the channel in the absence of membrane tension, 7 , 15 – 18 E. coli MscL has been engineered into controllable nanovalves that detect alternative modalities including light 19 and pH."
PMC3289768,PMC3289768_004,"20 The channel has been shown to be functional in vesicular-release devices, 19 – 21 as well as in an engineered microelectronic array chip; 22 its large pore size yields a robust response in such devices. However, for some purposes a smaller or adjustable pore size would be of advantage. The data presented within this study on E. coli MscL have two aspects: first, they resolve the issue of whether the CB disassociates upon normal channel opening, and second, they demonstrate that the MscL nanopore response can be effectively and reversibly modulated, which would have advantages in an assortment of potential nanodevices. We have demonstrated that the CB is quite stable, even upon channel opening. This finding suggested that the MscL nanovalve can be engineered to have a smaller pore size and conductance by decreasing the TM2/CB linker, which appears to serve as a molecular sieve."
PMC3289768,PMC3289768_005,"The linker can easily be modified in at least three ways: shortening by deletions, or constraining the region by either cross linking or heavy metal coordination; in later two cases the decreases in pore size are even reversible.

A crystal structure of a closed state of MscL shows it as a homopentamer, with each subunit consisting of two transmembrane domains (TM). There is consensus that the TM helices move in an iris like manner tilting in the plane of the membrane while gating. An N-terminal amphipathic helix that lies along the cytoplasmic membrane (S1), and the portion of TM2 near the cytoplasmic interface (TM2 ci ), are relatively close in the crystal structure, yet predicted to be dynamic upon gating."

We have screened 143 double-cysteine mutants of E. coli MscL for their efficiency in disulfide bridging and generated a map of protein-protein interactions between these two regions. Interesting candidates have been further studied by patch clamp and show differences in channel activity under different redox potentials; the results suggest a model for the dynamics of these two domains during MscL gating.

PMC3508904,PMC3508904_002,"17 We chose to perform this in vivo assay because it involves little or no manipulation of the protein and is therefore more likely to reflect real protein-protein interactions, eliminating possible artifacts occurring during protein purification. Briefly, bacteria expressing each double mutant were grown in high salt media and either diluted in media of the same osmolarity (control) or lower osmolarity (osmotic down-shock) with the oxidizing agent copper-phenanthroline. After a brief incubation the bacteria were pelleted, resuspended in sample buffer, run in an electrophoresis gel and visualized in a western blot with a MscL antibody. Interestingly, we found that interactions between S1 and TM2 ci domains are so efficient that only 1.5 µM copper-phenanthroline had to be used in order not to saturate the screen."

The 3D graph in Figure 2 summarizes our results. The X and Y axis are the residues from S1 (residues 2 to 12) and TM2 ci (residues 93 to 105) regions respectively, and the z axis reflects the percentage of total protein existing as multimers for each double cysteine mutant."

Furthermore, M12C/N103C single channel activity could only be seen after treatment with the reducing agent DTT, and the activity disappeared when oxidizer was added to the bath ( Fig. 3C ).

PMC3430326,PMC3430326_000,"Single-celled organisms must survive exposure to environmental extremes. Perhaps one of the most variable and potentially life-threatening changes that can occur is that of a rapid and acute decrease in external osmolarity. This easily translates into several atmospheres of additional pressure that can build up within the cell. Without a protective mechanism against such pressures, the cell will lyse. Hence, most microbes appear to possess members of one or both families of bacterial mechanosensitive channels, MscS and MscL, which can act as biological emergency release valves that allow cytoplasmic solutes to be jettisoned rapidly from the cell."
PMC3430326,PMC3430326_001,"While this is undoubtedly a function of these proteins, the discovery of the presence of MscS homologues in plant organelles and MscL in fungus and mycoplasma genomes may complicate this simplistic interpretation of the physiology underlying these proteins. Here we compare and contrast these two mechanosensitive channel families, discuss their potential physiological roles, and review some of the most relevant data that underlie the current models for their structure and function. It has been a given for many years that both MscS and MscL fulfill major roles in protecting cell integrity by serving the function of biological emergency release valves ( 46 ). However, while this is true, there may be many exceptions to this rule that have yet to be elucidated. Some key questions can be defined."
PMC3430326,PMC3430326_002,"(i) Do all bacterial MS channels, irrespective of their structure, play only the role of emergency release valve? Unambiguously, this is not the case for E. coli , for which there are five MS channels that do not fulfill this role ( 68 ). Alternative roles might be found in the work on chloroplast MS channels ( 78 ). These belong to the MscS family, and hints that they may influence shape maintenance and organelle division have arisen from their study ( 31 , 32 ). Given that chloroplasts are intracytoplasmic, they have no need to survive major changes in osmolarity. However, they might be essential in adjusting chloroplast volume during day/night cycles. A change in solute pools of around 40 mM is equivalent to ∼1 atm, and therefore, variations in the concentrations of carbon cycle intermediates and other metabolites may be a significant stress."
PMC3430326,PMC3430326_003,"In isolated membranes (i.e., patch clamp), channels may have thresholds measured in 0.1 atm (∼4 mM solute change) and thus might be engaged in metabolite pool management. While this would still be an osmotic role, protein colocalization studies have suggested proximity between chloroplast division machinery and the MS channels and this may couple osmotic changes to shape control and division. (ii) What do the differing portfolios of mechanosensitive channel homologues tell us about evolution to niche and/or creation of modified functions associated with MS channels? We have alluded above to the observed differences in MS channel distribution from the “norm.” Both Mycoplasma and Vibrio species may have modified their profiles of MS channels to reflect their major environmental hurdles."
PMC3430326,PMC3430326_004,"Can we learn more about an organism's niche from an evaluation of gene profiles and their expression matrices? (iii) How many copies of a channel does the cell need for survival? Recent work has suggested that, in contrast to previous studies, MscL may exist at >200 channels per cell ( 12 ). Many studies have shown that channel abundance in membrane patches does not always correlate with measured channel activity. Thus, do all channels exist in multiple states, only some of which are poised to be activated ( 15 , 38 )? (iv) In fungi, where are the MscL channels subcellularly? What is their function, and how do localization and function match up? Could these channels have a role in the complex life cycle that some fungi and oomycetes undertake, which often includes severe transitions in osmolyte and water content?"
PMC3430326,PMC3430326_005,"(v) Can the conserved nature of MscS and MscL be the Achilles' heel for bacteria? Much work has established the toxicity of MscL, MscS, MscK, and MscG mutants that gate inappropriately ( 6 , 45 , 47 , 53 – 55 , 64 , 65 ). Can we trigger gating using chemicals and, in this way, generate new antibiotics that act synergistically with compounds that weaken bacterial cell envelopes? Such speculation has been made previously ( 13 , 39 , 63 ). In theory, the conserved nature of MscL can be exploited for developing broad-spectrum antimicrobials. (vi) Bacterial mechanosensitive channels are some of the largest gated pores; MscL is perhaps the largest known ( 23 ). Seminal research has shown how these nanopores can be utilized for the delivery of peptides and other membrane-impermeable compounds."
PMC3430326,PMC3430326_006,"Indeed, the observation that a charge within the MscL pore can gate the channel has led to the engineering of nanopores that are actuated by light ( 43 ) and pH ( 42 ). We can now not only change the modality of MscL but also control the compounds that may pass through it ( 84 ), as well as reversibly modulate the pore size ( 85 ). Such channels may someday be utilized in a variety of nanodevices, including targeted drug delivery systems. Mechanosensitive channels have provided a paradigm for transient pore formation in bacterial membranes for almost 20 years. Much has been discovered about the structures and some of the structural transitions that they undertake. Yet much still remains to be discovered about the precise structural changes associated with the open and transition states, and these channels remain fertile ground for technology development."
PMC3430326,PMC3430326_007,"At the end of the day, we know a lot about these mechanosensitive channels in E. coli . However, there are clues in abundance that MscS-Ec and MscL-Ec are but two stories and that there are many more to be told that will reveal new insights into the way nature has developed and evolved this fascinating class of membrane proteins."
PMC3593973,PMC3593973_000,"MscL, the highly conserved bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, functionally serves as an osmotic “emergency release valve”, is among the best studied mechanosensors and a paradigm of how a channel senses and responds to membrane tension. While all homologues tested thus far encode channel activity, many show functional differences. Here we tested E. coli and S aureus chimeras and find that the periplasmic region of the protein, particularly E. coli I49 and the equivalent S aureus F47 at the periplasmic lipid-aqueous interface of the first transmembrane domain, drastically influences both the open dwell time and threshold of channel opening. One mutant shows a severe hysteresis, confirming the importance of this residue in determining the energy barriers for channel gating."

PMC3774184,PMC3774184_001,"Relative to age-matched controls, mice exposed to Mars-analog loading had significantly lower muscle mass (−23% gastrocnemius wet mass, P < 0.0001); trabecular and cortical bone morphology (i.e., trabecular bone volume: −24% at the distal femur, and cortical thickness: −11% at the femoral midshaft, both P < 0.001); and biomechanical properties of the femoral midshaft (i.e., −27% ultimate moment, P < 0.001). Bone formation indexes were decreased compared with age-matched full-weight-bearing mice, whereas resorption parameters were largely unchanged. Singly housed, full-weight-bearing controls with forelimb jackets were largely similar to age-matched, group-housed controls, although a few variables differed and warrant further investigation."
PMC3774184,PMC3774184_002,"Altogether, these data provide strong rationale for use of our new model of partial weight bearing to further explore the musculoskeletal response to reduced loading environments. Keywords: mice, unloading, disuse osteoporosis, partial weightbearing, spaceflight musculoskeletal deconditioning associated with spaceflight has been noted since the early days of the Gemini program. Despite rigorous exercise protocols and other countermeasures, negative calcium balance (∼0.5%/mo) and bone loss in weight-bearing bones (1.0–2.7%/mo) are still the hallmarks of flight ( 12 – 15 , 29 )."
PMC3774184,PMC3774184_003,"Although the mechanisms of disuse-induced bone loss and age-related bone loss are not identical, a 20% decline in femoral neck bone mineral density during a single year of spaceflight corresponds to 30 yr of age-related bone loss in a postmenopausal woman, bringing with it a significant increase in fracture risk ( 16 ). Furthermore, subject-specific finite-element analyses indicate that femoral bone strength declines by 2%/mo during spaceflight, with some astronauts exhibiting reductions in proximal femoral strength that are comparable to estimated lifetime losses in bone strength associated with aging ( 11 ). Whereas human spaceflight over the last 30 yr has been confined exclusively to low Earth orbit, and largely to flights of less than 6 mo, exploration goals once again reach beyond the Van Allen belts."
PMC3774184,PMC3774184_004,"Although the physiological effects of weightlessness are well described, the effects of chronic partial weight bearing, such as expected on the moon (16% of Earth's gravity) and Mars (38% of Earth's gravity), have yet to be quantified. In these environments, the risks of musculoskeletal atrophy and accompanying orthopedic injury are uncertain, and methods to further investigate adaptations to partial weight bearing are needed. Based on the paradigm that mechanical loading provides the primary stimulus for skeletal maintenance ( 4 , 10 , 24 ), it is likely that partial weight bearing will provide some prophylaxis against the deconditioning seen in conditions of full disuse. But how do adaptive processes scale with changes in gravitational loading?"
PMC3774184,PMC3774184_005,"Does a given decrease in gravitational acceleration lead to a proportionate decrease in bone and muscle mass, or is this response curve nonlinear? The answers to these questions are important, not only for aerospace physiology, but also for a better understanding of the effects of reduced weight bearing associated with clinical conditions and diseases. Accordingly, the objectives of this study were to develop a new rodent model of partial weight suspension (PWS) to explore these musculoskeletal effects of chronically reduced weight bearing and to conduct the first study of musculoskeletal adaptation to Mars gravity levels. We hypothesized that musculoskeletal adaptation to partial weight bearing would replicate the key features of adaptation to full unloading, including reduced bone formation rate, muscle mass, bone mass, and bone strength."
PMC4118556,PMC4118556_000,"Although the musculoskeletal system is known to be sensitive to changes in its mechanical environment, the relationship between functional adaptation and below-normal mechanical stimuli is not well defined. We investigated bone and muscle adaptation to a range of reduced loading using the partial weight suspension (PWS) system, in which a two-point harness is used to offload a tunable amount of body weight while maintaining quadrupedal locomotion. Skeletally mature female C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to partial weight bearing at 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 21 days. A hindlimb unloaded (HLU) group was included for comparison in addition to age-matched controls in normal housing. Gait kinematics was measured across the full range of weight bearing, and some minor alterations in gait from PWS were identified."
PMC4118556,PMC4118556_001,"With PWS, bone and muscle changes were generally proportional to the degree of unloading. Specifically, total body and hindlimb bone mineral density, calf muscle mass, trabecular bone volume of the distal femur, and cortical area of the femur midshaft were all linearly related to the degree of unloading. Even a load reduction to 70% of normal weight bearing was associated with significant bone deterioration and muscle atrophy. Weight bearing at 20% did not lead to better bone outcomes than HLU despite less muscle atrophy and presumably greater mechanical stimulus, requiring further investigation. These data confirm that the PWS model is highly effective in applying controllable, reduced, long-term loading that produces predictable, discrete adaptive changes in muscle and bone of the hindlimb.

However, given that these animals were not sacrificed on-orbit and instead returned live to earth, it is unclear if these disruptions were solely induced by space stressors (e.g. microgravity, space radiation) or in part explained by the stress of return to Earth. In this work we analyzed three liver datasets from two different strains of mice (C57BL/6 (Jackson) & BALB/c (Taconic)) flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Notably, these animals were sacrificed on-orbit and exposed to varying spaceflight durations (i.e. 21, 37, and 42 days vs 13 days for the Shuttle mice)."

Similarly, transcriptomic analysis by RNA-sequencing revealed several pathways that were affected in both strains related to increased lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, lipid and fatty acid processing, lipid catabolic processing, and lipid localization. In addition, key upstream regulators were predicted to be commonly regulated across all conditions including Glucagon (GCG) and Insulin (INS). Moreover, quantitative proteomic analysis showed that a number of lipid related proteins were changed in the livers during spaceflight."

Further, treatment of intact and ovariectomized mice with mBMPR1A‐mFc leads to increased bone mass, and improved bone microarchitecture and strength, via increased bone formation and reduced resorption. In this study, we tested the effects of mBMPR1A‐mFc on disuse‐induced bone loss caused by 21 days of hindlimb unloading (HLU) via tail suspension versus cage controls (CONs). Adult female C57BL/6J mice (12 weeks old) were assigned to one of four groups ( n = 10 each): CON‐VEH; CON‐mBMPR1A‐mFc; HLU‐VEH; and HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc.

Leg BMD increased significantly more in CON‐mBMPR1A‐mFc than CON‐VEH (10.2% ± 0.6% versus 4.4% ± 0.8%). In the femur, trabecular, and cortical bone microarchitecture was worse in the HLU‐VEH compared to CON‐VEH mice, whereas mBMPR1A‐mFc treatment for 3 weeks led to greater Tb.BV/TV, Tb.Th, and midshaft Ct.Th in both the HLU and CON groups compared to comparable VEH‐treated counterparts ( p < 0.05). HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc mice also had 21% greater failure load ( p < 0.05) compared to their VEH‐treated counterparts."

We performed whole transcriptomic profiling of cortical bone using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and RNA molecular barcoding (NanoString) on a hindlimb unloading (HLU) mouse model to identify genes whose mRNA transcript abundances change in response to disuse. Eleven-week old female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to ambulatory loading or HLU for 7 days (n = 8/group). Total RNA from marrow-flushed femoral cortical bone was analyzed on HiSeq and NanoString platforms. The expression of several previously reported genes associated with Wnt signaling and metabolism was altered by HLU. Furthermore, the increased abundance of transcripts, such as Pfkfb3 and Mss51, after HLU imply these genes also have roles in the cortical bone’s response to altered mechanical loading."

Previously, we have described that mice exposed to a single dose of simplified Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR 5-ion ) develop cardiovascular dysfunction by 12 months post-radiation. Methods: To investigate the biological basis of this dysfunction, here we performed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of heart tissue (proteome and phosphoproteome) and plasma (proteome only) from these mice at 8 months post-radiation."

Pathways related to inflammation were the most highly perturbed in the heart and plasma. In line with sustained inflammation, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were demonstrated to be increased in GCR 5-ion irradiated hearts at 12-month post irradiation.

We characterize the physiology of utricular afferents to applied accelerations in the oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau , in normal 1 g to establish benchmarks, after 1–32-day exposures to 2.24 g (resultant) via centrifugation (hypergravity, HG), after 4- and 16-day exposures to 1.12 g (resultant), and following 1–8 days recovery to HG exposures to study re-adaptation to 1 g.

Principal response to HG was an adjustment of afferent sensitivity as a function of magnitude and duration of exposure: an initial robust increase at 3–4 days followed by a significant decrease from 16 to 32 days. Initial increase observed after 4 days of HG took >4 days in 1 g to recover, and the decrease observed after 16 days of HG took >2 days to readapt to 1 g."

PMC4064004,PMC4064004_000,"Coat protein complex I (COPI) and COPII are required for bidirectional membrane trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi. While these core coat machineries and other transport factors are highly conserved across species, high-resolution imaging studies indicate that the organization of the ER–Golgi interface is varied in eukaryotic cells. Regulation of COPII assembly, in some cases to manage distinct cellular cargo, is emerging as one important component in determining this structure. Comparison of the ER–Golgi interface across different systems, particularly mammalian and plant cells, reveals fundamental elements and distinct organization of this interface."
PMC4064004,PMC4064004_001,"A better understanding of how these interfaces are regulated to meet varying cellular secretory demands should provide key insights into the mechanisms that control efficient trafficking of proteins and lipids through the secretory pathway. The secretory pathway in eukaryotic cells is responsible for biogenesis and proper intracellular distribution of a wide range of proteins, complex carbohydrates and lipids. Trafficking in the secretory pathway is highly dynamic and responsive to specific cellular functional demands. Forward transport (also known as anterograde transport) of newly synthesized proteins and lipids is initiated at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and, as such, ER-to-Golgi transport represents a vital gateway to the endomembrane system. Membrane traffic between the ER and the Golgi is bidirectional and occurs via similar mechanisms."
PMC4064004,PMC4064004_002,"In both cases, a carrier forms on the donor organelle and then tethers to and fuses with the target organelle ( FIG. 1 ). Distinct machineries facilitate the formation of carriers for anterograde and retrograde transport, which are thought to ensure fidelity and directionality of trafficking: coat protein complex II (COPII) operates in the anterograde pathway from the ER, and COPI functions in the retrograde route from the Golgi."
PMC4064004,PMC4064004_003,"Although in vitro studies suggest that the formation of COPI- and COPII-coated carriers is mechanistically similar and can occur via the action of minimal components (including heteromeric coat complexes, ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) and SAR1 (secretion-associated RAS-related 1) GTPases and their regulatory guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) ( BOX 1 ; BOX 2 ), other elements are necessary to coordinate the two trafficking routes in vivo and thereby maintain organelle structure and function. This is supported by evidence demonstrating that chemical disruption of the COPI route with the ARF GEF inhibitor brefeldin A leads to the collapse of ER export 1 , 2 , which may be due to depletion of proteins required for the formation of COPII carriers that occurs because Golgi-to-ER retrieval is blocked."
PMC4064004,PMC4064004_004,"Similarly, dominantnegative versions of SAR1 that block COPII assembly rapidly disrupt Golgi structure and function 1 . While the cellular functions of COPI and COPII as well as interdependence of the anterograde and retrograde trafficking routes are generally conserved across eukaryotes, the organization of the ER–Golgi interface varies greatly in different species. For example, plants and some yeast species have a compact organization of the ER and Golgi, whereas in animal cells the two organelles are separated by a pleomorphic intermediate compartment. The distribution of COPII budding sites on the ER, the nature of the transport vesicles themselves and the dependence on cytoskeletal components also vary."
PMC4064004,PMC4064004_005,"Furthermore, there seems to be enormous plasticity in the ER–Golgi interface, which can adapt to accommodate variations in COPII carrier size and number commensurate with cargo dimensions and quantity. A useful guide for the biologist’s view of the cell has been that structure reflects function. This perspective has been powerfully applied to the study of membrane traffic with an understanding that the molecular basis for observed membrane structures and dynamics is tightly coupled with function. In this Review, we focus on individual stages in membrane transport that influence organization of the ER–Golgi interface. Through a comparative analysis of model systems, we begin to see how this core structural machinery is adapted to meet cell-specific requirements."
PMC4064004,PMC4064004_006,"However, future studies will need to further integrate cellular regulatory networks that control biosynthetic rates and flux through trafficking routes with this core machinery. For example, changing developmental and environmental conditions that alter the profile of protein and lipid cargos must be integrated in a manner that maintains the organization of the ER–Golgi interface. Global regulation through the UPR clearly has a key homeostatic role in coordinating protein and lipid biosynthetic rates in response to environmental conditions. But studying how the UPR orchestrates such adaptation may be challenging because there are multiple branches of the UPR in animal and plant cells 53 , 111 , and these are likely to work in concert with several other signalling networks that regulate membrane traffic."

PMC4150462,PMC4150462_004,"Movement of the ER along the actin cytoskeleton has a significant influence on both its architecture and dynamics. Members of class XI myosin motor proteins have recently been shown to control the movement of the ER and other organelles such as Golgi bodies, peroxisomes and mitochondria. Griffing et al. ( 2014 ) explore a subset of class XI myosins with a focus on their role in regulating ER network remodeling by affecting ER tubulation, sheet formation and the persistence of these structures. In addition to the importance of these ER network dynamics for organelle communication, the ER may further directly provide the source membrane for vacuole biogenesis, as hypothesized by Viotti ( 2014 ). The majority of soluble vacuolar proteins travel from the ER to the Golgi complex."
PMC4150462,PMC4150462_005,"A growing number of reports however indicate that some proteins, including some vacuolar membrane proteins appear to reach the vacuole without visiting intermediate compartments of the endomembrane system. An essential function of the ER is the synthesis of secreted proteins. To insure that only correctly folded proteins are exported from the ER, eukaryotes have evolved ER quality control (ERQC) mechanisms, which supervise the folding process. Protein folding is monitored through the stepwise modification of oligosaccharide side chains on glycoproteins, and proteins that fail to fold correctly are extracted from the folding process and subjected to ER associated degradation (ERAD). Li and Liu ( 2014 ) describe the protein folding process and how client proteins are chosen for ERAD."
PMC4150462,PMC4150462_006,"Proper function of the ER is particular relevant under stress where the demand for secreted proteins exceed the ER working load capacity. Under such conditions, ER homeostasis requires cellular communication between the ER and the nucleus. Therefore, eukaryotes have signaling proteins on the ER membrane that sense impaired ER function (ER stress) through the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER and that employ different strategies to signal the nucleus. Some of these communication strategies are common to all eukaryotes, while others are unique to plants. Ruberti and Brandizzi ( 2014 ) compare the ER stress signal pathways between yeast, plants and animals and review the responses in plants, which vary from adaptive measures to cell death."
PMC4150462,PMC4150462_007,"The bZIP transcription factor bZIP28 represents an ER stress signaling factor that is tethered to the ER membrane under unstressed conditions but is mobilized and transferred to the nucleus upon stress. Srivastava et al. ( 2014 ) describe the structure of bZIP28 and underlying principles of bZIP28 mobilization in response to stress. ER stress activates the unfolded proteins response (UPR) and the ERAD system to eliminate misfolded proteins, which is vital for the establishment of an effective immune system. Tintor and Saijo ( 2014 ) introduce the significance of the ERQC in the synthesis of immune receptors and provide further insights into the causalities of ER function (UPR) and plant immunity. Despite its role in immunity, the ER has been hijacked by viruses to promote viral pathogenesis."
PMC4150462,PMC4150462_008,"As reviewed by Verchot ( 2014 ), viruses have developed sophisticated strategies to overload the ER protein folding machinery with viral encoded proteins in infected cells. Interestingly, this activates the UPR and up-regulates cellular chaperones that further aid in virus protein folding. The overall significance of the ER in stress adaption is however apparent and underlined by the review of Nakano et al. ( 2014 ) which, in addition to the biogenesis and evolution, discusses the putative function of ER bodies in abiotic and biotic stress. As ER-derived compartments ER bodies contain stress-associated proteins (e.g., various β-glucosidases of the PYK10 family) that are thought to enhance stress resilience by activating glucosinolates and glucosylated phytohormones. The study of Höwing et al."
PMC4150462,PMC4150462_009,"( 2014 ) further identified an immune-active function of the ER-localized cysteine endopeptidase AtCEP1. In addition to its function in developmental processes, AtCEP1 is expressed and localized to the ER network, which condenses around haustoria during powdery mildew infection. Knockout of AtCEP1 results in enhanced susceptibility, suggesting that AtCEP1 is involved in restricting fungal infection, possibly by controlling a defense-related programmed cell death (PCD) at the late stages of the interaction. Cells mount adaptive responses (e.g., UPR) to mitigate the damage caused by ER stress. However, when stress becomes so excessive that the ERQC system cannot meet the demands, then PCD ensues. Williams et al."

The articles published in this e-book summarize our current knowledge of the multi-functionality of the ER in stress adaptation. By providing a stable microenvironment for the synthesis of metabolites and secreted proteins, the ER functions as an intracellular stress sensory organelle and, accordingly, initiates and regulates adaptive responses to environmental stress."

PMC4378170,PMC4378170_000,"Xyloglucan is a polysaccharide that has important roles in the formation and function of the walls that surround growing land plant cells. Many of these plants synthesize xyloglucan that contains galactose in two different side chains (L and F), which exist in distinct molecular environments. However, little is known about the contribution of these side chains to xyloglucan function. Here, we show that Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) mutants devoid of the F side chain galactosyltransferase MURUS3 (MUR3) form xyloglucan that lacks F side chains and contains much less galactosylated xylose than its wild-type counterpart. The galactose-depleted xyloglucan is dysfunctional, as it leads to mutants that are dwarfed with curled rosette leaves, short petioles, and short inflorescence stems."
PMC4378170,PMC4378170_001,"Moreover, cell wall matrix polysaccharides, including xyloglucan and pectin, are not properly secreted and instead accumulate within intracellular aggregates. Near-normal growth is restored by generating mur3 mutants that produce no detectable amounts of xyloglucan. Thus, cellular processes are affected more by the presence of the dysfunctional xyloglucan than by eliminating xyloglucan altogether. To identify structural features responsible for xyloglucan dysfunction, xyloglucan structure was modified in situ by generating mur3 mutants that lack specific xyloglucan xylosyltransferases (XXTs) or that overexpress the XYLOGLUCAN L-SIDE CHAIN GALACTOSYLTRANSFERASE2 ( XLT2 ) gene. Normal growth was restored in the mur3-3 mutant overexpressing XLT2 and in mur3-3 xxt double mutants when the dysfunctional xyloglucan was modified by doubling the amounts of galactosylated side chains."
PMC4378170,PMC4378170_002,"Our study assigns a role for galactosylation in normal xyloglucan function and demonstrates that altering xyloglucan side chain structure disturbs diverse cellular and physiological processes. There have been considerable advances in understanding how changes in specific amino acids or nucleotides affect the ability of a protein or an RNA to fold and to function ( Wan et al., 2011 ; Sauer, 2013 ). By contrast, much less is known about how polysaccharide structure and function are affected by altering specific monosaccharides within its glycosyl sequence. Here, we report that xyloglucan, a plant cell wall polysaccharide, becomes dysfunctional rather than nonfunctional when its glycosyl sequence is altered. The term dysfunctional polysaccharide is used here to describe a structure that, in and of itself, has a deleterious effect on the growth and development of a plant."
PMC4378170,PMC4378170_003,"XXXG-type xyloglucans ( XyG s; Fig. 1A ) are present in the cell walls of many flowering plants ( Hoffman et al., 2005 ), gymnosperms ( Hsieh and Harris, 2012 ), ferns and their allies, club and spike mosses, and the avascular hornworts ( Peña et al., 2008 ). XyG s of this type are composed of subunits ( Fig. 1, A and B ) that have three consecutive β- d -glucopyranose (β- d -Glc p ) backbone residues bearing a side chain followed by a single unbranched β- d -Glc p residue ( Tuomivaara et al., 2015 ). Little is known about the contribution of these side chains to the role of XyG in wall structure and function, although the results of in vitro studies suggest that they modulate how an XyG interacts with cellulose ( Whitney et al., 2006 ) and with itself ( Shirakawa et al., 1998 ; de Freitas et al., 2011 )."
PMC4378170,PMC4378170_004,"We have shown that Arabidopsis mutants devoid of the F side chain galactosyltransferase MURUS3 form xyloglucan that lacks F side chains and contains much less galactosylated Xyl than wild-type xyloglucan. This xyloglucan structure is dysfunctional, as it leads to mutants that exhibit numerous growth defects. Near-normal growth is restored by eliminating the xyloglucan altogether or by increasing the extent of its galactosylation. The altered growth of the mur3 family of mutants and their responses to temperature, pathogens ( Tedman-Jones et al., 2008 ), and salt stress ( Li et al., 2013 ) reveal how modifying one element of a biochemical network, in this case, xyloglucan biosynthesis, may disturb diverse cellular and physiological processes."
PMC4378170,PMC4378170_005,"Such data provide additional evidence in support of the notion that altering wall structure affects numerous aspects of plant life ( Seifert and Blaukopf, 2010 ). Thus, the mur3 mutants provide a unique opportunity to increase our understanding of how changes in cell wall biosynthesis and structure affect plant growth and development as well as disease resistance and responses to environmental stimuli."
PMC4618186,PMC4618186_000,"To overcome endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, ER-localized stress sensors actuate distinct downstream organelle-nucleus signaling pathways to invoke a cytoprotective response, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Compared to yeast and metazoans, plant UPR studies are more recent but nevertheless fascinating. Here we discuss recent discoveries in plant UPR, highlight conserved and unique features of the plant UPR as well as critical yet-open questions whose answers will likely make significant contributions to the understanding plant ER stress management. In the last few years, numerous significant studies have contributed to the understanding of the UPR; this trend is likely to keep steady. Numerous fundamental questions are still open ( Box 2 )."
PMC4618186,PMC4618186_001,"Understanding the mechanisms of the plant UPR is important to define conserved and unique strategies for ER stress responses, and it offers exciting perspectives to improve plant productivity. While we are beginning to understand how the UPR intersects with hormone-regulated growth [ 37•• , 38 ], defense [ 5 , 24 , 39 ], and resistance to hostile environments [ 4 , 40 ], further insights into the temporal and spatial complexity of the UPR regulation will support biotechnological applications. For example, overexpression of rice IRE1 may lead to suppression of endogenous IRE1 expression, which may compromise endogenous defense [ 41 ]; on the other hand, overexpression of BiP proteins renders them more resistant to stress [ 42 , 43 ]."

PMC4453782,PMC4453782_000,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the gateway to the secretory pathway in all eukaryotic cells. Its products subsequently pass through the Golgi apparatus on the way to the cell surface (true secretion) or to the lytic compartment of the cell (vacuolar protein transport). In animal cells, the Golgi apparatus is present as a stationary larger order complex near the nucleus, and transport between the cortical ER and the Golgi complex occurs via an intermediate compartment which is transported on microtubules. By contrast, higher plant cells have discrete mobile Golgi stacks that move along the cortical ER, and the intermediate compartment is absent."
PMC4453782,PMC4453782_001,"Although many of the major molecular players involved in ER-Golgi trafficking in mammalian and yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) cells have homologs in higher plants, the narrow interface (less than 500 nm) between the Golgi and the ER, together with the motility factor, makes the identification of the transport vectors responsible for bidirectional traffic between these two organelles much more difficult. Over the years, a controversy has arisen over the two major possibilities by which transfer can occur: through vesicles or direct tubular connections. In this article, four leading plant cell biologists attempted to resolve this issue. Unfortunately, their opinions are so divergent and often opposing that it was not possible to reach a consensus. Thus, we decided to let each tell his or her version individually."
PMC4453782,PMC4453782_002,"The review begins with an article by Federica Brandizzi that provides the necessary molecular background on coat protein complexes in relation to the so-called secretory units model for ER-Golgi transport in highly vacuolated plant cells. The second article, written by Chris Hawes, presents the evidence in favor of tubules. It is followed by an article from David Robinson defending the classical notion that transport occurs via vesicles. The last article, by Akihiko Nakano, introduces the reader to possible alternatives to vesicles or tubules, which are now emerging as a result of exciting new developments in high-resolution light microscopy in yeast. Cell biology textbooks usually give a description of the Golgi apparatus as it is seen and functions in a mammalian cell."
PMC4453782,PMC4453782_003,"This is understandable considering the huge body of literature on this organelle in animal cells, especially in relation to disease. It also reflects and is designed to accommodate the large readership from the medical sciences. With few exceptions ( Ito et al., 2014 ), there are few reviews on the Golgi apparatus that give a balanced account of its structure and function across the whole eukaryotic kingdom. The plant Golgi apparatus is nevertheless a fascinating organelle that has unique features, especially when compared with its mammalian counterpart. It is polydisperse rather than being present as a continuous perinuclear ribbon, it does not disassemble during mitosis, and it is motile."
PMC4453782,PMC4453782_004,"These characteristics are of great importance, especially because Golgi stacks in plants, along with their protein processing functions, have been termed polysaccharide factories and their activity is essential for formation of a cell wall during cytokinesis and growth. Nevertheless, it is Golgi stack motility that makes bidirectional protein transport between the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and the Golgi apparatus in plants conceptually more difficult to grasp and therefore even more intriguing than others in other eukaryotic kingdoms. There is general consensus that in all eukaryotes, anterograde protein transport out of the ER is largely dependent upon Coat Protein II (COII) proteins and that retrograde transport both within the Golgi stack and between the Golgi and the ER requires COPI proteins ( Szul and Sztul, 2011 ; Barlowe and Miller, 2013 )."
PMC4453782,PMC4453782_005,"Because recruitment of proteins in yeasts and mammals culminates in the formation of a transport vesicle, it is logical to assume that this may also be the case for plants. However, whereas there appears to be no doubt about the formation and release of COPI vesicles at the periphery of plant Golgi cisternae ( Pimpl et al., 2000 ; Donohoe et al., 2007 ), the existence of COPII-coated vesicles and their operation as anterograde transport vectors in the narrow (less than 500 nm) interface between the ER and Golgi apparatus of land plants is a matter of considerable controversy ( Hawes et al., 2008 ; Hawes, 2012 )."
PMC4453782,PMC4453782_006,"By contrast, there are numerous examples among lower eukaryotes where electron micrographs reveal a Golgi stack immediately adjacent (less than 500 nm) to transitional ER , per definition, a domain of the ER (or nuclear envelope) showing vesicle budding profiles and lacking ribosomes. The best examples for this are probably the yeast Pichia pastoris ( Mogelsvang et al., 2003 ) and the algae Chlamydomonas noctigama ( Fig. 1, A and B ; Hummel et al., 2007 ), Tribonema vulgare , and Melosira varians (see Getty Images nos. 169272449 and 128618249; www.gettyimages.com ). ER vesiculation profiles have often been recorded for mammalian cells going right back to the early papers of George Palade (for references, see Tartakoff, 2002 ). Interestingly, in all of these cases, as with the algae just mentioned, classical chemical fixation was sufficient to obtain the images."
PMC4453782,PMC4453782_007,"Therefore, one would expect that higher plants would be no different in this regard. Unexpectedly, this is not the case. So far, only in rapidly frozen samples has it been possible to visualize ER vesiculation profiles. Even then, such images are rare ( Fig. 1, C and D ; Robinson et al., 2007 ; Kang and Staehelin, 2008 ; Langhans et al., 2012 ). After having gone through the information and arguments presented above, it will not come as a surprise to the reader that the authors found themselves unable to reach a consensus about the modality of membrane traffic between the ER and the Golgi apparatus in higher plants. While there is no question that COPII proteins are essential for this process, doubt continues as to whether vesicles are the vectors of bidirectional traffic between the two organelles."
PMC4453782,PMC4453782_008,"It is clear that fluorescence microscopy, immunolabeling, and live cell imaging in combination have revolutionized our conceptual understanding of the structure and functioning of the eukaryotic Golgi apparatus and its relationship with the ER . However, the present superresolution fluorescence microscopic techniques such as structured illumination microscopy, stimulated emission depletion microscopy, and photoactivated localization microscopy are not sufficient to unequivocally identify discrete individual COPII vesicles. On the other hand, new techniques such as SCLIM are emerging that have the potential for even higher superresolution not only in space, but also in time and may well bring about a breakthrough in understanding what really is going on in living cells."
PMC4453782,PMC4453782_009,"Of course, electron microscopy is still the most powerful technique to solve the finer structural details of the interface between the ER and the Golgi whether in chemically fixed or frozen samples. Thus, perhaps a combination of ultra-rapid freezing and freeze substitution combined with selective membrane staining and one of the new high-resolution three-dimensional scanning electron microscopy technologies such as focussed ion beam-scanning electron microscopy or serial block face imaging might solve some of the mysteries of the plant ER -Golgi interface and help settle the controversy explored in this article. Unfortunately, irrespective of the method of preparation and the type of imaging, the downside with electron microscopy is that only single Golgi stacks can be visualized, with the caveat that the one being visualized might temporarily not be engaged in trafficking with the ER ."
PMC4453782,PMC4453782_010,"There is also an issue with the experimental systems being used. Beautiful live-cell imaging data has been obtained with the leaf epidermis system, but obviously it will be interesting to explore other cell types. While it seems that the situation in tobacco BY2 cells is not too different from that of leaf epidermal cells, there are other cell types such as in the meristem or in the endosperm during cellularization whose secretion status is unclear and where it is difficult, especially by conventional live-cell imaging, to recognize a close spatial relationship between the ER and Golgi stacks, let alone being able to say anything about Golgi motility due to the sheer density of the cytoplasm. On the other hand, such cell types, because of their relatively high cytoplasm/cell volume ratio, freeze well and are therefore most suitable for electron microscopy studies."
PMC4453782,PMC4453782_011,"The reverse is true for leaf epidermal cells, which are excellent objects for live-cell imaging, but present an almost insurmountable obstacle for ultra-rapid freezing. It remains to say that, even with the ideal plant cell, to capture the complexity of bidirectional ER -Golgi traffic in plant cells, correlative light and electron microscopy is necessary. Establishing this technique for studies on plants is going to be a major challenge for the future."
PMC4902601,PMC4902601_000,"Photosynthesis occurs in mesophyll cells of specialized organs such as leaves. The rigid cell wall encapsulating photosynthetic cells controls the expansion and distribution of cells within photosynthetic tissues. The relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth is affected by leaf area. However, the underlying genetic mechanisms affecting carbon partitioning to different aspects of leaf growth are not known. To fill this gap, we analyzed Arabidopsis plants with altered levels of pectin methylesterification, which is known to modulate cell wall plasticity and plant growth. Pectin methylesterification levels were varied through manipulation of cotton Golgi-related ( CGR ) 2 or 3 genes encoding two functionally redundant pectin methyltransferases."
PMC4902601,PMC4902601_001,"Increased levels of methylesterification in a line over-expressing CGR2 (CGR2OX) resulted in highly expanded leaves with enhanced intercellular air spaces; reduced methylesterification in a mutant lacking both CGR -genes 2 and 3 (cgr2/3) resulted in thin but dense leaf mesophyll that limited CO 2 diffusion to chloroplasts. Leaf, root, and plant dry weight were enhanced in CGR2OX but decreased in cgr2/3. Differences in growth between wild type and the CGR -mutants can be explained by carbon partitioning but not by variations in area-based photosynthesis."
PMC4902601,PMC4902601_002,"Therefore, photosynthesis drives growth through alterations in carbon partitioning to new leaf area growth and leaf mass per unit leaf area; however, CGR -mediated pectin methylesterification acts as a primary factor in this relationship through modulation of the expansion and positioning of the cells in leaves, which in turn drive carbon partitioning by generating dynamic carbon demands in leaf area growth and leaf mass per unit leaf area. Photosynthesis is the major source of carbon (C) for plant growth. However, there is no clear correlation between area-based photosynthesis and plant growth, and studies have shown that the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth is affected by leaf area growth parameters."
PMC4902601,PMC4902601_003,"A strong positive correlation exists between relative growth rate and leaf growth parameters such as leaf area per unit leaf mass (specific leaf area, SLA ), leaf area per unit plant mass (leaf area ratio), and investment of C in leaf growth (leaf mass ratio; Shipley, 2002 ; Lambers et al., 2008 ; Poorter et al., 2009 ). In fact, modeled partitioning coefficients obtained from the Arabidopsis leaf area growth model showed that plant growth is more sensitive to changes in C partitioning to leaf thickening and leaf area growth than to changes to area-based photosynthesis ( Weraduwage et al., 2015 ). The term “thickening” was used to indicate increased mass per unit leaf area ( LMA ), whether that results from increased thickness in the normal sense of more depth to the leaf between adaxial and abaxial surfaces or from increased cell density. LMA is the reciprocal of SLA ."
PMC4902601,PMC4902601_004,"While LMA has been shown to positively and linearly correlate with investment to leaves in the form of anatomical and chemical composition changes, SLA shows a hyperbolic relationship with such changes ( Poorter et al., 2009 ). Therefore, we will mainly focus on LMA throughout this work. Weraduwage et al. (2015) concluded that even though photosynthetic C is required for growth, the degree of growth is determined by the amount of C partitioned to leaf area growth and LMA ( Weraduwage et al., 2015 ). However, how and to what degree this variation in leaf expansion and LMA is affected by cell wall properties of leaf mesophyll cells is not known. In addition, the underlying mechanisms that drive C partitioning to favor either leaf area growth or LMA , and the genes that can influence changes in C demands toward these two processes, are yet to be found."
PMC4902601,PMC4902601_005,"Leaves are the major photosynthetic organs in plants and regulation of cell expansion and growth is crucial for the development of leaf architecture. Leaf growth can occur in the form of leaf area or LMA ( Lambers et al., 2008 ; Weraduwage et al., 2015 ). The size and shape of cells in the leaf mesophyll can have a significant impact on: (1) projected or effective leaf surface area, which is the leaf area capable of intercepting light; (2) leaf mass per unit leaf area or LMA ; (3) CO 2 conductance from the external environment through intercellular air spaces into chloroplasts in mesophyll cells; and (4) surface area of mesophyll cells and chloroplasts exposed to intercellular airspaces ( Honda and Fisher, 1978 ; Evans et al., 1994 ; Galmés et al., 2013 )."
PMC4902601,PMC4902601_006,"The plant cell wall controls expansion and positioning of cells of photosynthetic tissues and therefore, changes in cell wall properties will have a direct impact on the above properties. Although there is evidence for changes in leaf architecture as a result of alterations in genes that affect the synthesis and properties of the cell wall ( Burton et al., 2000 ; Kim and Delaney, 2002 ; Pilling et al., 2004 ; Wolf et al., 2009 ; Kim et al., 2015 ), an in-depth analysis of effects on leaf gas exchange and overall plant growth under such circumstances has not yet been conducted. The plant cell wall is composed mainly of polysaccharides, and among these, pectin is considered a critical element that controls cell wall elasticity and expansion. Pectin is synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and secreted in a highly methylesterified form."
PMC4902601,PMC4902601_007,"Methylesterification of galacturonic acid (GalUA) is catalyzed by pectin methyltransferases ( Wolf et al., 2009 ; Kim et al., 2015 ). The level of pectin methylesterification in the cell wall is controlled by methylesterases and inhibitors of methylesterases, which modify the levels of methylation and demethylation of GalUA in the pectin backbone ( Wolf et al., 2009 ; Kim et al., 2015 ). Removal of methyl groups by methylesterases allows carboxyl groups of GalUA to form Ca 2+ - and Mg 2+ -mediated intermolecular linkages that lead to hardening of pectin ( Burton et al., 2000 ; Heldt and Piechulla, 2010 ; Kim et al., 2015 ). Indeed, over-expression of pectin methylesterase inhibitors results in longer root cells ( Lionetti et al., 2007 )."
PMC4902601,PMC4902601_008,"Therefore, the degree of methylation and demethylation of pectin determines the delicate balance between cell wall extensibility and rigidity with consequent effects on growth and shape of cells ( Burton et al., 2000 ; Pilling et al., 2004 ; Lionetti et al., 2007 ; Wolf et al., 2009 ; Xiao and Anderson, 2013 ; Kim et al., 2015 ). Consistent with this notion, over-expression of pectin methyltransferases, CGR2 or CGR3 , led to enhanced rosette size and fresh weight in Arabidopsis ( Kim et al., 2015 ). However, a double knockout of CGR2 and CGR3 genes, named cgr2/3 , showed reduced cell expansion and overall plant growth; both phenotypes correlated with reduced levels of pectin methylesterification compared to wild type ( Kim et al., 2015 )."
PMC4902601,PMC4902601_009,"To our knowledge, the effect of pectin methylation on leaf growth parameters, photosynthesis, and respiration through its effect on leaf architecture has not been studied. The goal of this study was to use the Arabidopsis model system developed by Kim et al. (2015) with altered levels of pectin methyltransferases, CGR2 or CGR3 (single gene modifiers found to positively or negatively affect cell expansion as a function of their cellular availability) to investigate how changes in cell-wall plasticity affect C assimilation, leaf respiration, and overall plant growth through effects on leaf area growth and mesophyll structure. We examined whether the changes in overall plant growth in Arabidopsis with altered CGR2 and CGR3 could result from changes in leaf area growth and LMA or changes in area-based photosynthesis to explore the relationship between photosynthesis and growth."
PMC4902601,PMC4902601_010,"Based on the differences in rosette size reported previously ( Kim et al., 2015 ), we hypothesized that area-based photosynthesis rates would be lower in a CGR2 over-expressor (CGR2OX) but larger in the mutant lacking both CGR2 and 3 genes ( cgr2/3 ). As CGR2 and CGR3 affect pectin methylation and cell expansion in leaves, we also hypothesized that plant growth would be enhanced in the CGR2OX line and reduced in the cgr2/3 mutant mainly as a result of altered LMA . Indeed, through analysis of leaf and plant growth, gas exchange, and growth modeling, we found that CGR 2 and CGR 3 have significant impacts on photosynthesis and respiration through alteration of mesophyll structure and LMA . Plant growth was enhanced in the CGR2OX line but reduced in the cgr2/3 mutant."
PMC4902601,PMC4902601_011,"This variation in plant growth was as a result of differences in C partitioning and not as a result of changes in photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area. These observations support a novel (to our knowledge) model that changes in cell wall plasticity due to changes in pectin composition influence C partitioning between leaf area growth and LMA , thereby regulating the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth. Our study supports the model that qualitative and quantitative changes in pectin in the cell wall have a significant impact on area-based photosynthesis and respiration through alterations in leaf thickness, mesophyll cell density, and area of the leaf blade. Such changes in mesophyll architecture directly altered LMA and consequently area-based respiration. CGR 2 and CGR 3 affected area-based photosynthesis by altering CO 2 availability at Rubisco."
PMC4902601,PMC4902601_012,"These genes could affect plant-based photosynthesis by enabling enhanced light capture through larger leaf area. These data emphasizes the importance of pectin methylesterification in fine-tuning cell expansion and size, and adhesion qualities when building an optimum leaf to maximize photosynthesis under different environmental conditions. While thin leaves are associated with reduced LMA , it is important to maintain an optimum thickness to maintain sufficient intercellular air spaces that would maintain high internal conductance as reflected in S mes and S c and therefore higher carboxylation rates. CGR2 and CGR3 , which directly alter the size of the leaf blade and mesophyll architecture, may find applications in the future to improve light interception in crop plant canopies. Over-expression of CGR2 had a significant positive effect on leaf area and plant growth."
PMC4902601,PMC4902601_013,"Suppression of CGR2 and CGR3 caused a marked increase in LMA , and a reduction in leaf area and plant growth. These differences resulted through changes in C partitioning to leaf area growth and growth in terms of LMA and not as a result of altered area-based photosynthesis rates. Therefore, photosynthesis drives plant growth through alterations in C partitioning to new leaf area growth and LMA growth, and this study discovered that pectin methylesterification affects this relationship by directly altering the degree of cell expansion and positioning in the leaves to create dynamic carbon demands in leaf area growth and leaf mass thereby driving C partitioning for these processes."
PMC4902601,PMC4902601_014,"Collectively, these results uncover an unexpected connection between cell wall composition and photosynthesis, and support the novel (to our knowledge) model that through its role in modulation of organ development, the cell wall plasticity is a key factor influencing photosynthetic processes in land plants."
PMC4776492,PMC4776492_000,"Eukaryotic cells require mechanisms to establish the proportion of cellular volume devoted to particular organelles. These mechanisms are poorly understood. From a screen for plastid-to-nucleus signaling mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana , we cloned a mutant allele of a gene that encodes a protein of unknown function that is homologous to two other Arabidopsis genes of unknown function and to FRIENDLY , which was previously shown to promote the normal distribution of mitochondria in Arabidopsis . In contrast to FRIENDLY , these three homologs of FRIENDLY are found only in photosynthetic organisms. Based on these data, we proposed that FRIENDLY expanded into a small gene family to help regulate the energy metabolism of cells that contain both mitochondria and chloroplasts."
PMC4776492,PMC4776492_001,"Indeed, we found that knocking out these genes caused a number of chloroplast phenotypes, including a reduction in the proportion of cellular volume devoted to chloroplasts to 50% of wild type. Thus, we refer to these genes as REDUCED CHLOROPLAST COVERAGE ( REC ). The size of the chloroplast compartment was reduced most in rec1 mutants. The REC1 protein accumulated in the cytosol and the nucleus. REC1 was excluded from the nucleus when plants were treated with amitrole, which inhibits cell expansion and chloroplast function. We conclude that REC1 is an extraplastidic protein that helps to establish the size of the chloroplast compartment, and that signals derived from cell expansion or chloroplasts may regulate REC1. Chloroplasts drive plant growth, development, and reproduction by converting solar energy into biologically useful forms of energy."
PMC4776492,PMC4776492_002,"Thus, the biogenesis and function of chloroplasts underpin crop yields and, indeed, life on Earth. Chloroplasts develop from proplastids during germination and leaf development ( 1 ). After chloroplast biogenesis, chloroplasts divide by binary fission. A number of mutant alleles enhance or reduce the size of individual chloroplasts by attenuating or promoting chloroplast division ( 2 ). Regardless of the size of individual chloroplasts, the proportion of cellular volume devoted to all chloroplasts appears indistinguishable from wild type in these mutants ( 3 – 5 ). Thus, the mechanism that establishes the size of the chloroplast compartment appears distinct from the mechanisms of chloroplast division. The cell expansion that drives the expansion of leaves also drives the proliferation of chloroplasts."
PMC4776492,PMC4776492_003,"Indeed, the proliferation of chloroplasts is so tightly correlated with cell expansion that the ratio of the size of the chloroplast compartment to the size of mesophyll cells is constant, regardless of cell size ( 2 , 6 , 7 ). Cell type exerts a major influence over the proportion of cellular volume devoted to the chloroplast. For instance, the size of the chloroplast compartment in mesophyll cells is larger than in epidermal cells. Thus, an extraplastidic mechanism appears to determine the size of the chloroplast compartment ( 6 ). However, during the expansion of leaves, chloroplasts are not completely submissive to the cell. Indeed, chloroplast dysfunction inhibits the expansion of leaves ( 8 )."
PMC4776492,PMC4776492_004,"Although mechanisms that establish the proportion of cellular volume devoted to particular organelles are of fundamental importance to biology, these mechanisms remain poorly understood ( 2 ). In the particular case of chloroplasts, understanding these mechanisms may lead to significant advances for agriculture. For example, introducing C 4 photosynthesis into rice, a plant that performs C 3 photosynthesis, is one strategy for potentially increasing yields from this important crop ( 9 ). C 3 and C 4 leaves are distinct at the metabolic, cellular, and anatomical levels ( 9 , 10 ). One of the conserved features of C 4 leaves is the increase and decrease in the size of the chloroplast compartment in bundle sheath and mesophyll cells, respectively, relative to C 3 leaves ( 10 )."
PMC4776492,PMC4776492_005,"The engineering of C 4 photosynthesis in important C 3 crops, such as rice, is thought to depend on the ability to rationally manipulate the size of the chloroplast compartment ( 11 ). We performed a screen for plastid-to-nucleus signaling mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana ( 12 ). From this screen, we obtained one mutant allele of a gene that encodes a protein of unknown function. This gene is homologous to two Arabidopsis genes that encode proteins of unknown function and to FRIENDLY . FRIENDLY and its orthologs promote the normal distribution of mitochondria in Arabidopsis and in nonphotosynthetic organisms ( 13 ). However, these three Arabidopsis homologs of FRIENDLY are found only in photosynthetic organisms."
PMC4776492,PMC4776492_006,"Based on these data, we thought that FRIENDLY may have expanded into a small gene family to help manage the energy metabolism of cells that contain both chloroplasts and mitochondria. We tested this idea by examining the phenotypes of mutants in which one, two, three, or all four of these genes are knocked out. We found that these mutants exhibited a number of chloroplast phenotypes, including a smaller chloroplast compartment relative to wild type. Thus, we named these genes REDUCED CHLOROPLAST COVERAGE ( REC ). We also found that the protein that contributes most to establishing the size of the chloroplast compartment, REC1, localizes to both the nucleus and the cytosol, and we provide evidence that signals derived from dysfunctional chloroplasts or the inhibition of cell expansion may regulate the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of REC1."
PMC5415411,PMC5415411_000,"Much like a factory, the endoplasmic reticulum assembles simple cellular building blocks into complex molecular machines known as proteins. In order to protect the delicate protein folding process and ensure the proper cellular delivery of protein products under environmental stresses, eukaryotes have evolved a set of signaling mechanisms known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) to increase the folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum. This process is particularly important in plants, because their sessile nature commands adaptation for survival rather than escape from stress. As such, plants make special use of the UPR, and evidence indicates that the master regulators and downstream effectors of the UPR have distinct roles in mediating cellular processes that affect organism growth and development as well as stress responses."

In mammalian and yeast cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during ER stress attenuate the UPR, negatively impacting cell survival. In plants, the relationship between the UPR and ROS is less clear. Although ROS develop during ER stress, the sources of ROS linked to ER stress responses and the physiological impact of ROS generation on the survival from proteotoxic stress are yet unknown. Here we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana the respiratory burst oxidase homologs, RBOHD and RBOHF, contribute to the production of ROS during ER stress."

PMC4033213,PMC4033213_000,"Low linear energy transfer (LET) gamma rays and high LET HZE (high atomic weight, high energy) particles act as powerful mutagens in both plants and animals. DNA damage generated by HZE particles is more densely clustered than that generated by gamma rays. To understand the genetic requirements for resistance to high versus low LET radiation, a series of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants were exposed to either 1GeV Fe nuclei or gamma radiation. A comparison of effects on the germination and subsequent growth of seedlings led us to conclude that the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the two types of radiation (HZE versus gamma) are roughly 3:1. Similarly, in wild-type lines, loss of somatic heterozygosity was induced at an RBE of about a 2:1 (HZE versus gamma). Checkpoint and repair defects, as expected, enhanced sensitivity to both agents."

Data from both our root hypersensitivity and LOH assays indicate that the RBE of HZE radiation is between two and four times that of gamma radiation. The increased sensitivity of plants to HZE suggests that not only the quantity, but also the complexity of DSBs induced by IR play an import part in determining the efficiency and accuracy of DNA repair."

While it is unclear what additional factors may be unique to or of special importance in the repair DSBs induced by one class of radiation versus another, it is apparent that the relative importance of ATM versus ATR shifts in response to HZE versus gamma radiation. The increased relative importance of ATR versus ATM in responding to damage induced by HZE suggests that treatment with high-LET radiation results, either directly of indirectly, in a significant increase in the amount of ssDNA in the cell."

Change point detection was first applied to the filtered g level, g filt , to identify differences in mean g levels in an unsupervised manner (Fig. 1 f). To break down the flight into regions of stable g levels, data within 10 s of each change point was subjected to secondary change point detection using a linear slope metric, which segmented the flight into regions of rapid “transition” (indicated by dotted lines, Fig. 1 g-i) and more stable regimes.

PMC11271499,PMC11271499_000,"Spending time in a microgravity environment is known to cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness via muscle unloading, which can be partly attributed to Ca 2+ dysregulation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca 2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently demonstrated that, in the soleus of space-flown mice, the Ca 2+ uptake ability of the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with the antioxidant, Manganese(III) meso -tetrakis( N -n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction."

We used flow cytometry to assess molecules on cells that were preserved during flight to define the differentiation state of the developing bone marrow macrophages; including CD11b, CD31, CD44, Ly6C, Ly6G, F4/80, Mac2, c-Fos as well as c-Fms. In addition, RNA was preserved during the flight and was used to perform a gene microarray. We found that there were significant differences in the number of macrophages that developed in space compared to controls maintained on Earth.

PMC3868799,PMC3868799_000,"Obesity is characterized by an increased recruitment of proinflammatory macrophages to the adipose tissue (AT), leading to systemic inflammation and metabolic disease. The pathogenesis of this AT inflammation, however, remains to be elucidated. The circulating adipokine leptin is increased in obesity and is involved in immune cell function and activation. In the present study, we investigated the role of leptin in the induction of obesity-associated inflammation. We generated radiation chimeric C57BL/6J mice reconstituted with either leptin receptor-deficient ( db / db ) or wild-type (WT) bone marrow and challenged them with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Mice reconstituted with db / db bone marrow (WT/db), had significantly lower body weight and adiposity compared with mice with WT bone marrow (WT/WT)."
PMC3868799,PMC3868799_001,"Gonadal AT in WT/db mice displayed a 2-fold lower expression of the inflammatory genes Tnfa , Il6 , and Ccl2 . In addition, gonadal fat of WT/db mice contained significantly fewer crown-like structures compared with WT/WT mice, and most of their AT macrophages expressed macrophage galactose-type C type lectin 1 (MGL1) and were C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2)-negative, indicative of an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Moreover, WT/db mice exhibited greater insulin sensitivity compared with WT/WT mice. These data show that disrupted leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived cells attenuates the proinflammatory conditions that mediate many of the metabolic complications that characterize obesity. Our findings establish a novel mechanism involved in the regulation of obesity-associated systemic inflammation and support the hypothesis that leptin is a proinflammatory cytokine."
PMC3868799,PMC3868799_002,"Obesity is positively correlated with a plethora of inflammatory diseases and a higher susceptibility to infections ( 1 ). Therefore, investigating the link between obesity and immune system function is of utmost importance. The close interplay between metabolic and inflammatory pathways is beneficial under physiological conditions but becomes deleterious with either nutrient scarcity or nutrient excess ( 2 ). Indeed, obesity is characterized by a state of low-grade inflammation ( 3 ) in which increased levels of inflammatory markers and leptin prevail in the expanding adipose tissue (AT) ( 4 , 5 ). This chronic low-grade inflammation is believed to be the origin of most the obesity-associated diseases ( 2 ). Macrophages have been identified as the major secretory cells in AT, contributing to systemic and local inflammation in obesity ( 6 , 7 )."
PMC3868799,PMC3868799_003,"AT macrophage (ATM) recruitment is increased dramatically with the expansion of fat mass, comprising up to 50% of AT cells in the obese state ( 6 ). In addition to being more numerous in obese subjects, ATMs differ in localization, phenotype, and function between lean and obese individuals. In the lean state, resident (type II) macrophages display an anti-inflammatory phenotype with high gene expression of Il10 , Mgl1 (macrophage galactose-type-C-type lectin 1), and Arg1 ( 8 ). Type II macrophages are mouse EGF-like module containing mucin-like hormone receptor-like 1 positive (F4/80 + ), cluster of differentiation molecule 11c negative (CD11c − ), MGL1 + (CD301) ( 9 ), and dispersed in the interstitial space between adipocytes ( 10 ) where they are believed to play a role in preserving AT integrity and maintenance."
PMC3868799,PMC3868799_004,"Conversely, obesity-recruited (type I) macrophages display a proinflammatory phenotype ( 9 ), have a high level of expression of Tnfa , Il6 and Nos2 ( 11 ) transcripts, and are F4/80 + , CD11c + , and MGL1 − ( 8 , 12 ). These cells form what is known as crown-like structures (CLSs) surrounding adipocytes and are involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance ( 13 ). Although macrophage involvement in AT inflammation with obesity is well characterized, little is known about the mechanistic basis for ATM accumulation. Leptin is involved in both innate and adaptive immunity ( 14 ). The long leptin receptor isoform (LepRb), responsible for leptin's physiological activities ( 15 ), has been identified on most immune cells including monocytes and macrophages ( 16 – 19 )."

Moreover, obesity is accompanied by sustained elevated circulating concentrations of leptin, resulting in leptin resistance ( 20 ). In the present study, we investigated whether leptin signaling in white blood cells was involved in the recruitment of proinflammatory ATMs in diet-induced obesity. We demonstrated that the absence of leptin-receptor signaling in white blood cells led to reduced weight gain and adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed db / db bone marrow-transplanted wild-type (WT) mice compared with HFD-fed mice that received WT bone marrow transplants. Mice that received db / db bone marrow also exhibited decreased AT inflammation."
PMC4960141,PMC4960141_000,"Metabolic and immune mediators activate many of the same signal transduction pathways. Therefore, molecules that regulate metabolism often affect immune responses. Leptin is an adipokine that exemplifies this interplay. Leptin is the body’s major nutritional status sensor, but it also plays a key role in immune system regulation. To provide an in vitro tool to investigate the link between leptin and innate immunity, we immortalized and characterized a leptin receptor-deficient macrophage cell line, DB-1. The cell line was created using bone marrow cells from leptin receptor-deficient mice. Bone marrow cells were differentiated into macrophages by culturing them with recombinant mouse macrophage colony stimulating factor, and passaged when confluent for 6 months. The cells spontaneously immortalized at approximately passage 20."

DB-1 cells were responsive to stimulation with interferon-γ as measured by increase in Nos2 transcript levels. In addition, DB-1 macrophages are not responsive to the chemotactic signaling of adipocyte conditioned media nor leptin when compared to primary WT macrophages.

We also compared the use of mRNA vs total RNA, reverse transcriptase, and primer usage for cDNA synthesis and submission. The use of mRNA for cDNA synthesis resulted in higher read counts but reverse transcriptase and primer usage had no statistical effects on read count.

In contrast, when the availability of either phosphate or oxygen was increased, no difference in final cell density was observed between spaceflight and normal gravity.

The purpose of the study was to determine whether putative modifications in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur are associated with changes in trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) with altered estrogen status in young (6 mon) and old (24 mon) female Fischer-344 rats. Animals were divided into 6 groups: 1) young intact, 2) old intact, 3) young ovariectomized (OVX), 4) old OVX, 5) young OVX plus estrogen replacement (OVX+E2), and 6) old OVX+E2. PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation was assessed in vitro using acetylcholine. Trabecular bone volume of the distal femoral metaphysis was determined by microCT."

The purpose of the present investigation was to determine 1) whether 7 and 14 days of skeletal unloading alters femoral bone and marrow blood flow and vascular resistance during reloading, and 2) whether putative changes in bone perfusion are associated with a gross structural remodeling of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur. Six-month old male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to 7-d or 14-d hindlimb unloading (HU) or weight-bearing control groups. Bone perfusion was measured following 10 min of standing (reloading) following the unloading treatment. Histomorphometry was used to determine PNA media wall thickness and maximal diameter. Bone blood flow, arterial pressure and PNA structural characteristics were used to calculate arterial shear stress and circumferential wall stress."

Intraluminal diameter of PNAs from 14-d HU rats (138 ± 5 μm) was smaller than that of control PNAs (162 ± 6 μm), and medial wall thickness was thinner in PNAs from 14-d HU (14.3 ± 0.6 μm) versus that of control (18.0 ± 0.8 μm) rats.

PMC3615599,PMC3615599_000,"Adipose tissue (AT), which typically comprises an increased percentage of body mass with advancing age, receives a large proportion of resting cardiac output. During exercise, an old age-associated inability to increase vascular resistance within the intra-abdominal AT may compromise the ability of the cardiovascular system to redistribute blood flow to the active musculature, contributing to the decline in exercise capacity observed in this population. We tested the hypotheses that 1 ) there would be an elevated perfusion of AT during exercise with old age that was associated with diminished vasoconstrictor responses of adipose-resistance arteries, and 2 ) chronic exercise training would mitigate the age-associated alterations in AT blood flow and vascular function."
PMC3615599,PMC3615599_001,"Young (6 mo; n = 40) and old (24 mo; n = 28) male Fischer 344 rats were divided into young sedentary (YSed), old sedentary (OSed), young exercise trained (YET), or old exercise trained (OET) groups, where training consisted of 10-12 wk of treadmill exercise. In vivo blood flow at rest and during exercise and in vitro α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstrictor responses in resistance arteries from AT were measured in all groups. In response to exercise, there was a directionally opposite change in AT blood flow in the OSed group (∼150% increase) and YSed (∼55% decrease) vs. resting values. Both α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstriction were diminished in OSed vs. YSed AT-resistance arteries."
PMC3615599,PMC3615599_002,"Exercise training resulted in a similar AT hyperemic response between age groups during exercise (YET, 9.9 ± 0.5 ml·min −1 ·100 −1 g; OET, 8.1 ± 0.9 ml·min −1 ·100 −1 g) and was associated with enhanced myogenic and α-adrenergic vasoconstriction of AT-resistance arteries from the OET group relative to OSed. These results indicate that there is an inability to increase vascular resistance in AT during exercise with old age, due, in part, to a diminished vasoconstriction of AT arteries. Furthermore, the results indicate that exercise training can augment vasoconstriction of AT arteries and mitigate age-related alterations in the regulation of AT blood flow during exercise."
PMC3615599,PMC3615599_003,"Keywords: aging, adipose tissue, blood flow, α-adrenergic vasoconstriction, exercise by the year 2030, individuals, 85 years and older, will constitute the fastest-growing segment of the population in the United States ( 1 ), and aging is associated with a decline in maximal exercise capacity ( 23 , 41 , 55 , 57 , 59 , 72 ), which may contribute to the adoption of a more sedentary lifestyle. During the transition from rest to exercise, a rapid redistribution of peripheral blood flow is essential to maintain central venous return and the instantaneous elevation of cardiac output ( 30 ), as well as augment oxygen (O 2 ) delivery to the active musculature to match the immediate increase (≤2 s) in O 2 consumption ( 7 )."
PMC3615599,PMC3615599_004,"However, during exercise ( 52 ), heat stress ( 38 ), and orthostatic challenges ( 61 ), whole-body hemodynamics (i.e., cardiac output distribution and perturbations in arterial pressure) are altered in old vs. young subjects. In particular, during exercise, old age-associated alterations in muscle blood flow ( 10 , 21 , 46 , 77 ) result in a mismatching of O 2 delivery to O 2 consumption ( 9 , 14 , 22 ), which would expectedly contribute to an age-related functional decline. Whether aging affects the distribution of blood flow to other tissues, such as adipose tissue (AT), during exercise remains to be determined. We have demonstrated recently that arterial pressure in old rats decreases during an orthostatic challenge, which was associated with an inability to elevate vascular resistance in white AT ( 61 )."
PMC3615599,PMC3615599_005,"Furthermore, there was a severely diminished α-adrenergic vasoconstriction in AT-resistance arteries with old age ( 61 ). Given that AT makes up a greater proportion of body composition with aging in rats ( 18 ) and humans ( 11 ), a reduced vasoconstriction of resistance vessels from this tissue could have significant ramifications on the ability to regulate AT blood flow in aged individuals to maintain arterial pressure and muscle blood flow during exercise ( 19 ). The primary role of white AT is the storage and mobilization of lipids. However, white AT is also regarded as an endocrine organ ( 27 ), as white adipocytes produce mediators that influence metabolism of lipids and glucose and immune responses ( 73 , 74 )."
PMC3615599,PMC3615599_006,"Regulation of AT blood flow is complex and largely influenced by pathologies {e.g., type II diabetes and insulin resistance ( 28 , 36 ), body composition [obesity ( 71 )], nutritional state [fasting vs. postprandial ( 70 )], and the anatomical location of AT [e.g., central vs. peripheral; for review, see Sotornik et al. ( 64 )]}. Although white AT lacks significant parasympathetic innervation ( 29 ), there is substantial neuroanatomical and neurochemical evidence of a differential sympathetic nervous system (SNS) innervation depending on anatomical location [for review, see Bartness and Bamshad ( 5 )]. Electrical stimulation of nerves innervating white AT results in a vasoconstriction that is abolished by the α-adrenergic receptor blockade ( 54 ), suggesting that the regulation of AT blood flow is influenced largely by the SNS."
PMC3615599,PMC3615599_007,"During short-duration exercise (<30 min) in young, healthy subjects, there is an immediate decrease in blood flow to the viscera ( 2 ), as well as subcutaneous and epididymal AT ( 45 ), likely consequent to activation of sympathetic vasoconstrictor neurons. The reduction of blood flow to these tissues during exercise contributes, in part, to the effective redistribution of cardiac output to maximize perfusion of the active musculature and maintenance of systemic vascular resistance ( 2 , 19 ). However, given the old age-associated diminution of α-adrenergic vasoconstriction in resistance arteries from white AT ( 61 ), it is likely that AT blood flow will either remain similar to resting values or possibly be elevated during the transition from rest to exercise with old age."
PMC3615599,PMC3615599_008,"As AT receives a large proportion of cardiac output (∼8–12%) under normal resting conditions ( 18 ), old age-associated alterations in AT blood flow could have significant consequences on the ability to redirect blood flow to active tissue during physical activity in the elderly population. However, the effects of aging and exercise on AT blood flow are unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to test the hypotheses that with old age, 1 ) there is an inability to modulate AT blood flow during short-duration dynamic exercise, and 2 ) the altered adipose blood flow response with old age will be associated with a diminished α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstriction of resistance arteries from AT."
PMC3615599,PMC3615599_009,"Given the ability of exercise training to enhance adrenergic vasoconstriction in muscle that is not actively recruited during exercise ( 43 ), as well as myogenic vasoconstriction ( 50 ), the second part of this study was to determine whether chronic exercise training can 1 ) mitigate putative alterations in AT perfusion during exercise and 2 ) improve α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstriction in adipose-resistance arteries. In summary, α-adrenergic receptor-mediated and myogenic vasoconstriction in AT-resistance arteries are diminished with aging, which was associated with an increase in AT blood flow during exercise in the OSed group. Exercise training augmented adrenergic vasoconstriction in adipose arteries with old age, which likely contributed, in part, to the reduction in adipose blood flow during exercise relative to sedentary counterparts."

PMC4050424,PMC4050424_002,"Keywords: orthostatic hypotension, microgravity, microcirculation Orthostatic hypotension was found to manifest among the astronauts of Project Mercury after only brief excursions into space, making this condition one of the first medical complications reported to occur in astronauts ( 1 , 2 ). Following short-term flight (2–3 wk) on the space shuttle, 20–50% of astronauts exhibit orthostatic hypotension when reexposed to normal gravitational stress ( 3 – 5 ), with the prevalence of this condition rising markedly after longer term (4–6 mo) habitation in microgravity ( 6 ). This orthostatic hypotension is due, in part, to a diminished ability to elevate peripheral vascular resistance (PVR; refs. 3 , 7 – 9 ). One possible mechanism for the impaired ability to elevate PVR following spaceflight is a reduced magnitude or rate of vasoconstriction of the arterial resistance vasculature."
PMC4050424,PMC4050424_003,"Ground-based human and animal models used to simulate the effects of microgravity suggest decrements in vasoconstrictor responsiveness of arterial segments in various regions of the body, including the splanchnic circulation ( 10 – 13 ), as a potential mechanism contributing to orthostatic hypotension in astronauts. In the face of a spaceflight-associated reduction in PVR, cardiac output would have to be augmented in order to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) during an orthostatic challenge. However, the ability to augment cardiac output following simulated microgravity is diminished, owing to decrements in stroke volume ( 14 , 15 ). Venous filling pressure can affect stroke volume via the Starling mechanism and is largely regulated by systemic venous capacitance, of which the splanchnic region has the greatest capacitance ( 16 )."
PMC4050424,PMC4050424_004,"Because veins from the mesentery are responsive to sympathetic activity ( 17 ), active baroreceptor-mediated venoconstriction would mobilize mesenteric venous blood volume centrally to maintain venous filling pressure and stroke volume, while a diminished adrenergic and/or myogenic constriction of mesenteric veins after spaceflight would impair this process. Previous investigations simulating microgravity in rats have demonstrated diminished adrenergic and pressure-induced constriction of mesenteric veins ( 13 , 18 ). However, little is known about the effects of spaceflight on the intrinsic vaso- or venoconstrictor properties of the mesenteric vasculature or whether putative alterations in vasomotor responses are reversible."

Based on previous results from studies using ground-based simulations of microgravity ( 12 , 13 , 18 ), we hypothesized that spaceflight will diminish the magnitude of adrenergic KCl- and caffeine-evoked vasoconstriction in mesenteric arteries, and that this decrement will be related to altered sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ handling; and that spaceflight will blunt adrenergic constriction of mesenteric veins across a range of intraluminal pressures. In addition, we hypothesized that the putative decrements in adrenergic vasoconstriction are reversible within 1 wk of return to Earth's gravitational influences."

Vasoconstriction evoked through voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels (KCl; Fig. 2 A ) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ release (caffeine; Fig. 3 A ) was also diminished in arteries from SF mice. The blunted constriction to caffeine was associated with lower arterial RyR-2 ( Fig. 2 B ) and RyR-3 ( Fig. 2 C ) mRNA, indicating that the vasoconstrictor dysfunction of mesenteric arteries from SF mice occurs through an impairment of the ryanodine receptor-mediated intracellular Ca 2+ release mechanism."

The adrenergic vasoconstrictor dysfunction persisted 1 d postspaceflight ( Fig. 4 A ), but was normalized 5 d after landing ( Fig. 4 B ). Finally, spaceflight blunted NE-evoked constriction of mesenteric veins ( Fig. 5 A ).

However, given autoregulatory mechanisms that prevent cerebral perfusion from increasing in the presence of elevations in arterial perfusion pressure ( 4 , 5 ), a putative rise in cerebral arterial pressure ( P a ) of 20–30 mmHg in a microgravity environment ( 6 ) would not be expected to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) and, correspondingly, fluid filtration into the cranium to drive elevations in intracranial pressure."

Results : HU increased lumen diameter of both forelimb arteries but decreased diameter of the sural artery; the saphenous artery diameter was not affected."
PMC7339929,PMC7339929_001,"Following HU, maximal contractile responses to noradrenaline and serotonin increased in the forelimb but decreased in the hindlimb skeletal muscle feed arteries with no change in skin arteries; all region-specific alterations persisted after endothelium removal. HU increased the sensitivity to vasoconstrictors in the saphenous artery but not in the sural artery. In the saphenous artery, initially high sympathetic innervation density was reduced by HU, sparse innervation in the sural artery was not affected. Electrical stimulation of periarterial sympathetic nerves in isobarically perfused segments of the saphenous artery demonstrated a two-fold decrease of the contractile responses in HU rats compared to that of controls. Conclusion : HU induces contrasting structural and functional adaptations in forelimb and hindlimb skeletal muscle arteries."
PMC7339929,PMC7339929_002,"Additionally, HU had diverse effects in two hindlimb vascular regions. Hyper-sensitivity of the saphenous artery to vasoconstrictors appears to result from the shortage of trophic sympathetic influence. Importantly, HU impaired sympathetically induced arterial vasoconstriction, consistent with the decreased sympathetic constrictor response in humans following space flight. Keywords: microgravity, hindlimb unloading, rat, small arteries, remodeling, sympathetic innervation, noradrenaline, serotonin A novel result of this study is that simulated microgravity differentially affects the skin and skeletal muscle arteries in the hindlimb."
PMC7339929,PMC7339929_003,"Functional alterations in the vasoconstrictor responses of sparsely innervated skeletal muscle arteries appear to primarily result from the direct effects of physical forces acting on smooth muscle or endothelial cells to induce a gross structural remodeling of these arteries. However, functional changes in the densely innervated cutaneous arteries appear to be mainly governed by the effect of transmural pressure on periarterial sympathetic innervation. If similar adaptations occur in the peripheral vasculature of human cosmonauts and astronauts, such changes could underlie the weaker arterial vasoconstriction during activation of the sympathetic nerves, as well as serve as a mechanism of reduced vascular resistance and orthostatic intolerance following a return to Earth."

The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight induces epigenomic and transcriptomic reprogramming in the retina or alters the epigenetic clock. The mice were flown for 37 days in animal enclosure modules on the International Space Station; ground-based control animals were maintained under similar housing conditions. Mouse retinas were isolated and both DNA methylome and transcriptome were determined by deep sequencing.

Here we describe epithelial growth, hair cell density, stereocilia polarization, and afferent nerve innervation during development. The otolith maculae epithelial areas increased exponentially throughout embryonic development reaching asymptotic values near post-hatch day P7. Increases in hair cell density were dependent upon macular location; striolar hair cells developed first followed by hair cells in extrastriola regions. Stereocilia polarization was initiated early, with defining reversal zones forming at E8. Less than half of all immature hair cells observed had non-polarized internal kinocilia with the remaining exhibiting planar polarity. Immunohistochemistry and neural tracing techniques were employed to examine the shape and location of the striolar regions."

Calyx afferents innervating only type I hair cells did not develop until E14. Finally, the topographic organization of afferent macular innervation in the adult quail utricle was quantified. Calyx and dimorph afferents were primarily confined to the striolar regions, while bouton fibers were located in the extrastriola and type II band. Calyx fibers were the least complex, followed by dimorph units. Bouton fibers had large innervation fields, with arborous branches and many terminal boutons.

In the current study, we used discrete rotational and translational motion stimuli to characterize canal- and otolith-driven response components of convergent non-eye movement (NEM) neurons in the vestibular nuclear complex of alert pigeons. When compared to afferent responses, convergent canal signals had similar gain and phase ranges but exhibited greater spatial variability in their axes of preferred rotation.

We drove expression of a gain-of-function Ca V 1.2 mutant channel (Ca V 1.2 TS ) using Col2a1-Cre, which we found to target osteochondral/osteoblast progenitors in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule. Col2a1-Cre;Ca V 1.2 TS mice displayed osteopetrosis of these bones shown by μCT 3D reconstruction, histological analysis, and lack of bone sculpting, findings similar to phenotypes seen in mice with an osteoclast defect."

Further, we found that Col2a1-Cre;Ca V 1.2 TS mice experienced hearing loss and displayed defects of body balance in behavior tests, confirming that the Ca V 1.2-dependent Ca 2+ influx affects bone structure in the ear and consequent hearing and vestibular functions."

However, experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) now allow physical clarity with regard to any assumptions regarding the role of gravity in establishing fundamental root auxin distributions.

Plants on orbit, growing in the absence of any physical reference to the terrestrial gravity vector, displayed typically “vertical” distribution of auxin in the primary root. This confirms that the establishment of the auxin-gradient system, the primary guide for gravity signaling in the root, is gravity independent. The cytokinin distribution in the root tip differs between spaceflight and the ground controls, suggesting spaceflight-induced features of root growth may be cytokinin related.

PMC5491145,PMC5491145_000,"Experimentation on the International Space Station has reached the stage where repeated and nuanced transcriptome studies are beginning to illuminate the structural and metabolic differences between plants grown in space compared to plants on the Earth. Genes that are important in establishing the spaceflight responses are being identified, their roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation are increasingly understood, and the fact that different genotypes adapt differently is recognized. However, the basic question of whether these spaceflight responses are actually required for survival has yet to be posed, and the fundamental notion that spaceflight responses may be non-adaptive has yet to be explored."
PMC5491145,PMC5491145_001,"Therefore the experiments presented here were designed to ask if portions of the plant spaceflight response can be genetically removed without causing loss of spaceflight survival and without causing increased stress responses. The CARA experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptome responses in the root tips of two Arabidopsis ecotypes, Col-0 and WS, as well as that of a PhyD mutant of Col-0. When grown with the ambient light of the ISS, phyD plants displayed a significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome response compared to Col-0, suggesting that altering the activity of a single gene can actually improve spaceflight adaptation by reducing the transcriptome cost of physiological adaptation."
PMC5491145,PMC5491145_002,"The WS genotype showed an even simpler spaceflight transcriptome response in the ambient light of the ISS, more broadly indicating that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the cost of spaceflight adaptation, as measured by transcriptional response. These differential genotypic responses suggest that genetic manipulation could further reduce, or perhaps eliminate the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. When plants were germinated and then left in the dark on the ISS, the WS genotype actually mounted a larger transcriptome response than Col-0, suggesting that the in-space light environment affects physiological adaptation, which implies that manipulating the local habitat can also substantially impact the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation."
PMC5491145,PMC5491145_003,"The primary conclusion of this work is that much of the plant response to spaceflight is potentially non-adaptive in that at least most of the gene expression responses could be genetically eliminated without overtly compromising growth in space. This suggests that responses to truly novel environments may include responses from signals that are inappropriately activated or misinterpreted, and further suggests that these inappropriate responses can be genetically eliminated without adverse consequences. For spaceflight in particular, these data suggest that genetic manipulation can produce varieties that are better adapted to growth in spaceflight through elimination of unnecessary responses. A secondary conclusion of this work is that there is no fundamental spaceflight response that characterizes plant physiological adaptation to spaceflight."
PMC5491145,PMC5491145_004,"Rather, the adaptive response is dependent upon the genotype of the plant and the specific environment within which it grows. The response also appears highly organ specific, as roots and leaves share few spaceflight differential genes in common [ 38 , 47 ]. And yet, it remains possible and even likely that classes of differentially expressed genes will continue to be shared amongst cell types, genotypes and environments in space. However there is no overt indication that specific genes will be differentially expressed in all spaceflight plants. These conclusions lie in sharp contrast to evolutionarily defined and well characterized terrestrial stress responses. Heat shock, cold shock, salt, pathogen attack and other stresses show commonality of differential expression across cell types and local environments. HSPs are HSPs in all plant cells."
PMC5491145,PMC5491145_005,"Since no such commonality exists in spaceflight responses, it appears that at least large portions of the spaceflight responses in plants are not necessary, and therefore can be eliminated without negative impact on plant life in spaceflight and opening the possibility of selecting plant genotypes optimized for spaceflight growth. The differential expression of categories of genes, rather than individual genes, exhibited in the overall plant spaceflight response could be interpreted as support for the notion that certain categories of responses are either necessary for spaceflight physiological adaptation, or a common consequence of interpreting this novel environment. A common theme that appears to remain consistent among plant spaceflight transcriptomes is that of cell wall remodeling."
PMC5491145,PMC5491145_006,"Genes encoding proteins associated with cell wall remodeling have characterized the spaceflight response among several experiments and genotypes [ 23 , 38 , 47 , 48 , 51 , 52 , 56 , 57 , 65 ]. Cell wall remodeling genes are represented in the differentially expressed genes are richly represented in this experiment as well ( Fig 6 , Supporting S2 and S3 Tables). Thus cell wall remodeling appears to be, for the most part, a requirement or an unavoidable consequence of spaceflight physiological adaptation. Yet the differential gene expression that characterizes that response may be highly cell, genotype and environment specific, and indeed may not actually be required for successful adaptation."

PMC6201722,PMC6201722_001,"More recently, NDVI has been adapted for use in fields and greenhouses growing crops under natural sunlight (reviewed in Yengoh et al., 2014 ). Indoor farming is being increasingly relied upon to grow crops in unfavorable environments such as urban areas, areas of extreme temperature, and eventually to support the expansion of human life off‐planet. Because of the completely closed environment of an indoor farm, the early and rapid correction of abiotic stressors such as salt imbalance, low water content, nitrate concentration, and high pH is essential to maintaining plant health and advancing indoor farming applications. Traditional NDVI technology is not ideal for use in indoor farming scenarios because growing crops indoors relies upon fully controlled, artificial lighting for plant growth (Specht et al., 2014 )."
PMC6201722,PMC6201722_002,"Traditional artificial light sources used to grow crops in controlled conditions focus on optimizing photosynthesis. The use of artificial lighting containing near‐infrared (NIR) wavelengths enables NDVI‐like evaluations of plants in closed environments. This article demonstrates that NDVI analysis in controlled container environments is an applicable and useful tool in plant health monitoring. Controlled plant stress assays are used to validate the ability of modified NDVI imaging to detect evidence of stress before visual detection. To demonstrate the diverse applications of this approach, two different stress treatments were tested, two different plant species were assayed, and two different growth mediums were utilized."
PMC6201722,PMC6201722_003,"This work refined an alternate version of the commonly used equation for NDVI, single‐image NDVI (SI‐NDVI), to make early plant stress detection in controlled conditions utilizing NIR and full‐spectrum visible light worthwhile to growers. NDVI is traditionally calculated as a ratio of the spectral reflectance patterns of plant leaves in both the red (590–670 nm) and NIR (700–1100 nm) bands using the equation: In contrast, SI‐NDVI relies on comparison between spectral reflectance in the blue and NIR bands using the equation: Typically, two sensors are needed for NDVI analysis: one to record red light reflectance, and a second to record NIR reflectance (Rouse et al., 1973 ; Tucker and Choudhury, 1987 ). After image capture, precise optical alignment of the two images is then necessary to calculate NDVI."
PMC6201722,PMC6201722_004,"Cameras developed for SI‐NDVI employ a dual bandpass filter such that the single red, green, and blue (RGB) image can be manipulated into a differential image. The dual bandpass filter blocks green, yellow, orange, and red light while allowing blue and NIR light to pass through, repurposing the function of the red channel of the complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor for NIR. NDVI analysis requires comparison between a portion of the visible light spectrum and the NIR spectrum. For SI‐NDVI, blue light reflectance, as opposed to red light reflectance, is utilized to represent the normalizing portion of the visible light spectrum while the dual bandpass filter lets the red channel of the CMOS sensor record NIR."
PMC6201722,PMC6201722_005,"This modification enables SI‐NDVI analysis using only a single image after parsing the red and blue signals from the image sensor and thus avoids the technically challenging optical alignment process. Implementation of the SI‐NDVI imaging system enables early stress detection in plants while remaining both cost effective and user friendly. Cost efficiency is due in part to the fact that computer software required for SI‐NDVI analysis is open source and easily accessible. SI‐NDVI analysis allows for both quantitative and qualitative analysis of plant health in controlled environments, thereby making it applicable to lay persons as well as scientists. Qualitative data analysis utilizes Fiji (or ImageJ; Schindelin et al., 2012 ), a completely free open source program that is used to produce false color images and color index maps."
PMC6201722,PMC6201722_006,"For quantitative analysis, Excel spreadsheet software (Excel 2010 version 14.0.7212.5000 [64‐bit]; Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, USA) is used to track SI‐NDVI color index trends over time. Additional cost savings in this system are based on the lowering cost of commercially available cameras that can be modified for this use, in comparison to the high price of hyper‐spectral imagers."
PMC6240453,PMC6240453_000,"Both microarrays and RNA‐Seq proved applicable to the small samples. A total of 4180 genes were differentially expressed (with fold changes of 2 or greater) between Zone 1 and Zone 2. In addition, 771 unique genes and 19 novel transcriptionally active regions were identified by RNA‐Seq that were not detected in microarrays. However, microarrays detected spaceflight‐relevant genes that were missed in RNA‐Seq."
PMC6447593,PMC6447593_000,"Plants grown in spaceflight experience novel environmental signals, including those associated with microgravity and ionizing radiation. Spaceflight triggers a response involving transcriptional re-programming and altered cell morphology, though many aspects of this response remain uncharacterized. We analyzed the spaceflight-induced transcriptome with a focus on genes that undergo alternative splicing to examine differential splicing associated with spaceflight—an unstudied characteristic of the molecular response to spaceflight exposure. RNA sequence data obtained during the APEX03 spaceflight experiment that was collected from two Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes at two seedling stages grown onboard the International Space Station, or as ground controls at Kennedy Space Center, were re-examined to detect alternative splicing differences induced by spaceflight."

The nominal operation of the greenhouse started on February 7th and continued until the 20th of November. The purpose of the facility is to enable multidisciplinary research on topics related to future plant cultivation on human space exploration missions. Research on food quality and safety, plant health monitoring, microbiology, system validation, human factors and horticultural sciences was conducted. Part of the latter is the determination of the biomass production of the different crops. The data on this topic is presented in this paper."
PMC7264257,PMC7264257_001,"During the first season 26 different crops were grown on the 12.5 m 2 cultivation area of the greenhouse. A large number of crops were grown continuously throughout the 9 months of operation, but there were also crops that were only grown a few times for test purposes. The focus of this season was on growing lettuce, leafy greens and fresh vegetables. In total more than 268 kg of edible biomass was produced by the EDEN ISS greenhouse facility in 2018. Most of the harvest was cucumbers (67 kg), lettuces (56 kg), leafy greens (49 kg), and tomatoes (50 kg) complemented with smaller amounts of herbs (12 kg), radish (8 kg), and kohlrabi (19 kg). The environmental set points for the crops were 330–600 μmol/(m 2* s) LED light, 21°C, ∼65% relative humidity, 1000 ppm and the photoperiod was 17 h per day."

Detailed production values (edible and inedible biomass) for each crop species are shown in this paper as well as dry biomass ratios. Comparisons of the EDEN ISS yield from 2018 to other experiments are made. The EDEN ISS MTF is the newest and most state-of-the-art space greenhouse analog experiment currently ongoing. The dataset presented in this paper can be of value to compare future experiments to and also for simulation and modeling efforts of space greenhouses. Furthermore, this first EDEN ISS biomass production data set states the beginning of a series of experimental seasons in Antarctica, which will continuously be recorded and published over the next years."
PMC7264257,PMC7264257_004,"One unique aspect of this research was the cultivation of all crops together in the same space under the same conditions. Although, this means that the conditions were not optimal for each cultivar, this is closer to how crop cultivation is going to be done in near-term space greenhouses, in which environmentally separated compartments for each crop are too costly and technically complex. This is in opposition to most laboratory experiments, in which crops are grown under optimal conditions."
PMC7064724,PMC7064724_000,"The observation that plant roots skew in microgravity recently refuted the long-held conviction that skewing was a gravity-dependent phenomenon. Further, spaceflight root skewing suggests that specific root morphologies and cell wall remodeling systems may be important aspects of spaceflight physiological adaptation. However, connections between skewing, cell wall modification and spaceflight physiology are currently based on inferences rather than direct tests. Therefore, the Advanced Plant Experiments-03-2 (APEX-03-2) spaceflight study was designed to elucidate the contribution of two skewing- and cell wall-associated genes in Arabidopsis to root behavior and gene expression patterns in spaceflight, to assess whether interruptions of different skewing pathways affect the overall spaceflight-associated process."
PMC7064724,PMC7064724_001,"SPIRAL1 is a skewing-related protein implicated in directional cell expansion, and functions by regulating cortical microtubule dynamics. SKU5 is skewing-related glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein of the plasma membrane and cell wall implicated in stress response signaling. These two genes function in different cellular pathways that affect skewing on the Earth, and enable a test of the relevance of skewing pathways to spaceflight physiological adaptation. In this study, both sku5 and spr1 mutants showed different skewing behavior and markedly different patterns of gene expression in the spaceflight environment. The spr1 mutant showed fewer differentially expressed genes than its Col-0 wild-type, whereas sku5 showed considerably more than its WS wild-type."
PMC7064724,PMC7064724_002,"Developmental age played a substantial role in spaceflight acclimation in all genotypes, but particularly in sku5 plants, where spaceflight 4d seedlings had almost 10-times as many highly differentially expressed genes as the 8d seedlings. These differences demonstrated that the two skewing pathways represented by SKU5 and SPR1 have unique and opposite contributions to physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The spr1 response is less intense than wild type, suggesting that the loss of SPR1 positively impacts spaceflight adaptation. Conversely, the intensity of the sku5 responses suggests that the loss of SKU5 initiates a much more complex, deeper and more stress related response to spaceflight. This suggests that proper SKU5 function is important to spaceflight adaptation."

Veggie is housed in the Columbus module ( Figure 1A , left), and for the APEX-03 experiment, configured to accommodate racks of 10 cm Petri plates ( Figure 1A , middle). Images of plant growth and morphology were recorded by astronaut Butch Wilmore just prior to harvest ( Figures 1A , right, B ). Col-0 and WS can display distinct patterns of root growth in response to environmental stimuli. In terrestrial environments, changing the angle of the growth surface can create ecotype-specific patterns of skewing ( Rutherford and Masson, 1996 ; Schultz et al., 2017 )."
PMC7064724,PMC7064724_004,"In a microgravity environment with a gradient light source to impart a tropic cue, skewing patterns of WS and Col-0 recapitulate the patterns seen on terrestrial angled growth surfaces ( Paul et al., 2012a ). However, in a microgravity environment with uniform, non-directional lighting such as provided by the Veggie hardware in the current experiment, root growth patterns are more disorganized ( Figure 1B ). Nonetheless, skewing trends can still be discerned by following the angles of growth as the roots develop, and these are quantified in Figure 2A for Col-0 and spr1 , and in Figure 2B for WS and sku5 . In all representations and discussions of skewing, the direction indicated is from the perspective of being viewed from behind the growth medium."
PMC7064724,PMC7064724_005,"The physiological adaptation of sku5 to spaceflight is characterized by powerful stress responses, as well as the strong induction of LEAs and other genes associated with seed development. In contrast to sku5 , spr1 differentially expressed fewer genes than Col-0 to physiologically adapt to spaceflight. This observation suggests that the spr1 mutation imbued an enhanced ability for rapid spaceflight acclimation while sku5 required an extended spaceflight response to accomplish acclimation, even to the point of initiating classic deep stress responses. These observations further suggest that the functional distinctions between sku5 and spr1 inform distinct aspects of the spaceflight response in plants, in particular the responses of young seedlings."
PMC7064724,PMC7064724_006,"The dramatic responses of sku5 suggest that lipid raft nanodomains of the plasma membrane and their associated GPI-APs play important roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation. The fact that sku5 and spr1 show markedly different gene expression patterns in spaceflight suggests that the two skewing pathways highlighted by SKU5 and SPR1 differentially affect the mechanisms used by plants to physiologically acclimate to spaceflight. Since spr1 and sku5 root lengths are not altered by spaceflight, the effects of these mutations lie not in the process of growth, but in the processes that direct morphology and structure, likely tying together the large number of cell wall remodeling genes observed as differentially expressed in spaceflight."
PMC7064724,PMC7064724_007,"The data from APEX-03-2 therefore provide an initial functional dissection of the spaceflight response in roots, one that allows an integration of pathways associated with root directionality, morphology and physiological responses to spaceflight."
PMC6379395,PMC6379395_000,"The effects of spaceflight on cartilaginous structure are largely unknown. To address this deficiency, articular cartilage (AC) and sternal cartilage (SC) from mice exposed to 30 days of microgravity on the BION-M1 craft were investigated for pathological changes. The flight AC showed some evidence of degradation at the tissue level with loss of proteoglycan staining and a reduction in mRNA expression of mechano-responsive and structural cartilage matrix proteins compared to non-flight controls. These data suggest that degradative changes are underway in the AC extracellular matrix exposed to microgravity. In contrast, there was no evidence of cartilage breakdown in SC flight samples and the gene expression profile was distinct from that of AC with a reduction in metalloproteinase gene transcription."
PMC6379395,PMC6379395_001,"Since the two cartilages respond differently to microgravity we propose that each is tuned to the biomechanical environments in which they are normally maintained. That is, the differences between magnitude of normal terrestrial loading and the unloading of microgravity dictates the tissue response. Weight-bearing articular cartilage, but not minimally loaded sternal fibrocartilage, is negatively affected by the unloading of microgravity. We speculate that the maintenance of physiological loading on AC during spaceflight will minimize AC damage.

PMC4187166,PMC4187166_000,"Spaceflight imposes several unique stresses on biological life that together can have a profound impact on the homeostasis between eukaryotes and their associated microbes. One such stressor, microgravity, has been shown to alter host-microbe interactions at the genetic and physiological levels. Recent sequencing of the microbiomes associated with plants and animals have shown that these interactions are essential for maintaining host health through the regulation of several metabolic and immune responses. Disruptions to various environmental parameters or community characteristics may impact the resiliency of the microbiome, thus potentially driving host-microbe associations towards disease."
PMC4187166,PMC4187166_001,"In this review, we discuss our current understanding of host-microbe interactions in microgravity and assess the impact of this unique environmental stress on the normal physiological and genetic responses of both pathogenic and mutualistic associations. As humans move beyond our biosphere and undergo longer duration space flights, it will be essential to more fully understand microbial fitness in microgravity conditions in order to maintain a healthy homeostasis between humans, plants and their respective microbiomes.

PMC4187166,PMC4187166_002,"It is increasingly clear that astronauts, and other eukaryotic hosts, should be considered as metaorganisms, whose crosstalk and interactions with their microbes at the genetic and cellular level have redefined our definition of health and disease [ 106 ]. As manned exploration of space continues beyond the biosphere, it will be critical to examine the stability and resiliency of the human and plant metaorganism to spaceflight-induced stresses, including microgravity. For example, if keystone microbes are lost in the host community, this may result in a shift in species diversity and richness of the microbiome, thus potentially facilitating the rise of opportunistic pathogens that might otherwise be contained by the normal microbial community. To the microbe, eukaryotes simply represent a complex environment in which it must perpetually navigate and adapt to maintain its fitness [ 22 ]."
PMC4187166,PMC4187166_003,"This adaptation can occur through horizontal gene transfer events, and recent sequencing evidence suggests that in humans, the microbiome is a hotspot for genetic transfer, facilitating the exchange of antibiotic resistance, food digestion and nutrient metabolism genes that may provide the microbe a competitive advantage within the host community [ 3 , 107 ]. Understanding the nature and frequency of such events, as well as the overall stability of the microbiome under microgravity conditions, will not only help elucidate how microgravity alters this dynamic microbial landscape but will help enable the formation of new strategies for maintenance and potential restoration of the healthy microbiome during spaceflight."
PMC5219934,PMC5219934_000,"Recent research has shown that the microbiota affects the biology of associated host epithelial tissues, including their circadian rhythms, although few data are available on how such influences shape the microarchitecture of the brush border. The squid-vibrio system exhibits two modifications of the brush border that supports the symbionts: effacement and repolarization. Together these occur on a daily rhythm in adult animals, at the dawn expulsion of symbionts into the environment, and symbiont colonization of the juvenile host induces an increase in microvillar density. Here we sought to define how these processes are related and the roles of both symbiont colonization and environmental cues. Ultrastructural analyses showed that the juvenile-organ brush borders also efface concomitantly with daily dawn-cued expulsion of symbionts."
PMC5219934,PMC5219934_001,"Manipulation of the environmental light cue and juvenile symbiotic state demonstrated that this behaviour requires the light cue, but not colonization. In contrast, symbionts were required for the observed increase in microvillar density that accompanies post dawn brush-border repolarization; this increase was induced solely by host exposure to phosphorylated lipid A of symbiont cells. These data demonstrate that a partnering of environmental and symbiont cues shapes the brush border and that microbe-associated molecular patterns play a role in the regulation of brush-border microarchitecture."

To understand the processes that influence the origin of specialized symbiotic organs, we report the sequencing and analysis of the genome of Euprymna scolopes , a model cephalopod with richly characterized host–microbe interactions. We identified large-scale genomic reorganization shared between E. scolopes and Octopus bimaculoides and posit that this reorganization has contributed to the evolution of cephalopod complexity. To reveal genomic signatures of host–symbiont interactions, we focused on two specialized organs of E. scolopes : the light organ, which harbors a monoculture of Vibrio fischeri , and the accessory nidamental gland (ANG), a reproductive organ containing a bacterial consortium. Our findings suggest that the two symbiotic organs within E. scolopes originated by different evolutionary mechanisms."

Compared with other tissues, the light organ showed an abundance of genes associated with immunity and mediating light, whereas the ANG was enriched in orphan genes known only from E. scolopes . Together, these analyses provide evidence for different patterns of genomic evolution of symbiotic organs within a single host. Numerous organisms have specialized organs to house their microbiota, yet the evolutionary processes underlying the origin of these tissues are not well understood ( 1 – 4 )."

In the light organ (LO) of E. scolopes , a monospecific association with the bioluminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri provides camouflage for the host and triggers a coordinated developmental remodeling of the surrounding epithelial tissues ( 6 ). Additionally, E. scolopes harbors a complex microbial consortium in the accessory nidamental gland (ANG), a component of the female reproductive system of many squids and cuttlefish that is hypothesized to play a role in egg defense ( Fig. 1 B ) ( 7 , 8 )."

Therefore, to define elements of genome structure and function that are critical for symbiosis and the evolution of cephalopods, we sequenced and characterized the E. scolopes genome, the first example from the superorder Decapodiformes. Our analyses of the Hawaiian bobtail squid genome revealed large-scale genome reorganization, which preceded the coleoid cephalopod radiation, and provide evidence for two different patterns of genomic evolution that contributed to functional novelty."
PMC6386654,PMC6386654_004,"First, the extensive structural reorganization through the loss of ancient bilaterian microsynteny and increase in genome size through repetitive element expansions resulted in a unique genomic architecture that may have contributed to the innovations in the general cephalopod body plan. Second, the coding and surrounding regulatory regions of microbe-associated tissues suggest distinctive evolutionary patterns, such as the expansion of genes associated with immunity and light production in the LO. In the ANG, the prevalence of taxon-specific, or orphan, gene expression suggests a highly derived organ that evolved by a different means than the LO, perhaps due to unique selection pressures. Overall, our results set the stage for further functional analysis of genomic innovations that led to the evolution of symbiotic organs in a morphologically and behaviorally complex clade."

Here, the impact of modeled microgravity on the shedding of Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by the symbiotic bacterium Vibrio fischeri was examined using high-aspect ratio vessels. LPS from V. fischeri is known to induce developmental apoptosis within its symbiotic tissues, which is accelerated under modeled microgravity conditions. In this study, we provide evidence that exposure to modeled microgravity increases the amount of LPS released by the bacterial symbiont in vitro. The higher rates of shedding under modeled microgravity conditions are associated with increased production of outer-membrane vesicles (OMV), which has been previously correlated to flagellar motility.

PMC11362537,PMC11362537_000,"The ISS rodent habitat has provided crucial insights into the impact of spaceflight on mammals, inducing symptoms characteristic of liver disease, insulin resistance, osteopenia, and myopathy. Although these physiological responses can involve the microbiome on Earth, host-microbiota interactions during spaceflight are still being elucidated. We explore murine gut microbiota and host gene expression in the colon and liver after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight using multiomics. Metagenomics revealed significant changes in 44 microbiome species, including relative reductions in bile acid and butyrate metabolising bacteria like Extibacter muris and Dysosmobacter welbionis . Functional prediction indicate over-representation of fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, extracellular matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance genes."
PMC11362537,PMC11362537_001,"Host gene expression described corresponding changes to bile acid and energy metabolism, and immune suppression. These changes imply that interactions at the host-gut microbiome interface contribute to spaceflight pathology and that these interactions might critically influence human health and long-duration spaceflight feasibility. Subject terms: Microbial communities, Microbial genetics, Metagenomics, Microbiota Through metagenomic assessment of the murine gut microbiome, significant spaceflight-associated changes in bacteria linked to bile and fatty acid metabolism were identified. These changes in relative abundance were largely consistent in two groups of mice after spaceflight when compared to different on-Earth control groups at different timepoints as well as when using distinct metagenomic methodologies."
PMC11362537,PMC11362537_002,"The microbiome changes coincided with substantial changes to gene expression at the host-gut microbiome interface which are critical to barrier function, microbe interactions and bile acid transport in the intestine. These interactions suggest disruption of the signals, metabolites, and immune factors exchanged across the gut-liver axis which are likely to drive glucose and lipid dysregulation. Collectively, these multiomic findings suggest host-gut microbiome interactions during spaceflight are likely to underly widespread changes to host physiology which could pose a risk to health."
PMC9111996,PMC9111996_000,"While studies have shown an increase in pathogenicity in several microbes during spaceflight and after exposure to simulated microgravity, the mechanisms underlying these changes in phenotype are not understood across different pathogens, particularly in opportunistic pathogens. This study evaluates the mechanism for increased virulence of the opportunistic gram-negative bacterium, Serratia marcescens, in simulated microgravity. Low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) is used in ground-based studies to simulate the effects of microgravity as experienced in spaceflight. Our previous findings showed that there was a significant increase in mortality rates of the Drosophila melanogaster host when infected with either spaceflight or LSMMG treated S. marcescens . Here, we report that LSMMG increases asparagine uptake and synthesis in S."
PMC9111996,PMC9111996_001,"marcescens and that the increased host lethality induced by LSMMG bacteria grown in rich media can be recapitulated in minimal media by adding only aspartate and glutamine, the substrates of asparagine biosynthesis. Interestingly, increased bacterial growth rate alone is not sufficient to contribute to maximal host lethality, since the addition of aspartate to minimal media caused an LSMMG-specific increase in bacterial growth rate that is comparable to that induced by the combination of aspartate and glutamine, but this increase in growth does not cause an equivalent rate of host mortality. However, the addition of both aspartate and glutamine cause both an increase in host mortality and an overexpression of asparagine pathway genes in a LSMMG-dependent manner."
PMC9111996,PMC9111996_002,"We also report that L-asparaginase-mediated breakdown of asparagine is an effective countermeasure for the increased host mortality caused by LSMMG-treated bacteria. This investigation underscores the importance of the asparagine utilization pathway by helping uncover molecular mechanisms that underlie increased mortality rates of a model host infected with microgravity-treated S. marcescens and provides a potential mitigation strategy.

PMC10308117,PMC10308117_000,"A single strain from the family Paenibacillaceae was isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in April 2018, as part of the Microbial Tracking mission series. This strain was identified as a gram-positive, rod-shaped, oxidase-positive, catalase-negative motile bacterium in the genus Cohnella , designated as F6_2S_P_1 T . The 16S sequence of the F6_2S_P_1 T strain places it in a clade with C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli , which were originally isolated from plant tissue or rhizosphere environments. The closest 16S and gyrB matches to strain F6_2S_P_1 T are to C. rhizosphaerae with 98.84 and 93.99% sequence similarity, while a core single-copy gene phylogeny from all publicly available Cohnella genomes places it as more closely related to C. ginsengisoli ."
PMC10308117,PMC10308117_001,"Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values to any described Cohnella species are <89 and <22%, respectively. The major fatty acids for strain F6_2S_P_1 T are anteiso-C 15:0 (51.7%), iso-C 16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C 15:0 (10.5%), and it is able to metabolize a wide range of carbon compounds. Given the results of the ANI and dDDH analyses, this ISS strain is a novel species within the genus Cohnella for which we propose the name Cohnella hashimotonis , with the type strain F6_2S_P_1 T (=NRRL B-65657 T and DSMZ 115098 T ). Because no closely related Cohnella genomes were available, this study generated the whole-genome sequences (WGSs) of the type strains for C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli .

PMC10308117,PMC10308117_003,"hashimotonis and the C. ginsengisoli clade as a whole. All species of Cohnella closely related to C. hashimotonis are from the plant/rhizosphere environment and likely have mutualistic associations with plant roots or other tissue. It is likely, therefore, that C. hashimotonis was introduced to the ISS not as a human commensal but as a plant commensal during one of the many plant growth experiments conducted on board. Nevertheless, C. hashimotonis can clearly survive in the extreme conditions of the ISS built environment, including radiation exposure, desiccation, low nutrient availability, and microgravity, and is closely related to a number of rhizosphere bacteria; it is therefore a promising candidate for testing as a member of plant-growth-promoting consortia for future plant experiments in outer space."
PMC10233975,PMC10233975_000,"In total, 46 MAGs were assembled from 21 ISS environmental metagenomes, in which metaSPAdes yielded 20 MAGs and metaWRAP generated 26 MAGs. Among 46 MAGs retrieved, 18 bacterial species were identified, including one novel genus/species combination ( Kalamiella piersonii ) and one novel bacterial species ( Methylobacterium ajmalii ). In addition, four bins exhibited fungal genomes; this is the first-time fungal genomes were assembled from ISS metagenomes. Phylogenetic analyses of five bacterial species showed ISS-specific evolution. The genes pertaining to cell membranes, such as transmembrane transport, cell wall organization, and regulation of cell shape, were enriched. Variations in the antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) and virulence genes of the selected 20 MAGs were characterized to predict the ecology and evolution of biosafety level (BSL) 2 microorganisms in space."
PMC10233975,PMC10233975_001,"Since microbial virulence increases in microgravity, AMR gene sequences of MAGs were compared with genomes of respective ISS isolates and corresponding type strains. Among these 20 MAGs characterized, AMR genes were more prevalent in the Enterobacter bugandensis MAG, which has been predominantly isolated from clinical samples. MAGs were further used to analyze if genes involved in AMR and biofilm formation of viable microbes in ISS have variation due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure. Comparative analyses of MAGs and whole-genome sequences of related ISS isolates and their type strains were characterized to understand the variation related to the microbial evolution under microgravity. The Pantoea / Kalamiella strains have the maximum single-nucleotide polymorphisms found within the ISS strains examined."
PMC10233975,PMC10233975_002,This may suggest that Pantoea / Kalamiella strains are much more subjective to microgravity changes.

PMC10848226,PMC10848226_000,"The microbiome of the built environment comprises bacterial, archaeal, fungal, and viral communities associated with human-made structures. Even though most of these microbes are benign, antibiotic-resistant pathogens can colonize and emerge indoors, creating infection risk through surface transmission or inhalation. Several studies have catalogued the microbial composition and ecology in different built environment types. These have informed in vitro studies that seek to replicate the physicochemical features that promote pathogenic survival and transmission, ultimately facilitating the development and validation of intervention techniques used to reduce pathogen accumulation. Such interventions include using Bacillus -based cleaning products on surfaces or integrating bacilli into printable materials."
PMC10848226,PMC10848226_001,"Though this work is in its infancy, early research suggests the potential to use microbial biocontrol to reduce hospital- and home-acquired multidrug-resistant infections. Although these techniques hold promise, there is an urgent need to better understand the microbial ecology of built environments and to determine how these biocontrol solutions alter species interactions. This review covers our current understanding of microbial ecology of the built environment and proposes strategies to translate that knowledge into effective biocontrol of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Keywords: indoor microbiome, biocontrol, probiotic cleaning, bacillus, antibiotic resistance, built environment, AMR, metabolic modelling Probiotic intervention studies in hospitals [ 22-24 , 99 , 100 ] have demonstrated the potential to revolutionize cleaning approaches in healthcare facilities."
PMC10848226,PMC10848226_002,"However, much is still unknown about their mechanism of action, as well as how additional factors could influence their efficaciousness in situ . Further investigation of how spores germinate and competitively exclude other microbes in these dry, nutrient-depleted environments is needed for the successful development and broad deployment of probiotic cleaners. To answer these questions, we must use a variety of experimental strategies, including varied application methods (i.e. how the cleaner is applied and at what concentration is the cleaner most effective), inclusion of taxonomically diverse pathogenic microbes at varied concentrations, and a characterization of whole community dynamics in response to cleaner application."
PMC10848226,PMC10848226_003,"These experiments will require highly controlled and easily manipulatable conditions, and therefore, laboratory testing will be essential for determining the relative importance of factors associated with method of use, humidity, nutrient availability, surface material type, and cleaning regimes. Further, simulating transmission events of microbes from surfaces to humans will be needed to more fully understand how probiotic cleaners influence transmission rates of taxa of interest. Differential use patterns of healthcare facilities might alter best practices for probiotic cleaner use. For example, it is unknown how the magnitude of response might vary between different wards or rooms."
PMC10848226,PMC10848226_004,"Patient rooms and bathrooms have been the primary focus of intervention studies; however, other shared spaces, such as hallways or visitor areas, also carry the potential for pathogen accumulation and transmission risk. Additionally, long-term monitoring is crucial to detect whether the pathogens in these environments begin to adapt to this new cleaning method and therefore become resistant to biocontrol. Such a situation could start an evolutionary “arms race” with unknown outcomes. It is crucial to consider the health and emotional impacts on the patients and staff. Sociological studies on healthcare workers and patients are necessary to understand the perception that patients, staff, and the public have about the use of these novel products and to involve their feedback in product design and application."
PMC10848226,PMC10848226_005,"The popularity of probiotics in popular foods and drinks could help alleviate concerns, but deploying them in hospitals, especially around high-risk patients, will likely be controversial. Understanding the perception of these products, and explaining how and why they work, will aid in successful widespread adoption across healthcare systems. As seen in studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, harsh cleaning treatments using bleach may inhibit the probiotic and phage cleaners, so it will be imperative that staff are trained in how to properly treat surfaces cleaned with probiotics. Beyond direct application to the engineering of probiotic materials [ 85 ], 3D printing is primed to be the future of microbial biocontrol in built environments."
PMC10848226,PMC10848226_006,"Recent advances in 3D printing have resulted in materials that can be printed at low enough temperatures that spores and even live bacteria are not harmed during the assembly process. Unlike previous efforts, which used hydrogels [ 85 ], these new approaches can enable the printing of ceramics or hard plastics with improved utility as building materials. Using genome-enabled metabolic modelling to select bacteria that are optimized for these printing processes presents unique opportunities for built environment-specific designs that could be used to manipulate the ecology of these environments in prescribed ways. If this trend continues, we may soon be able to print tiles, furniture, or even entire structures out of sustainably produced microbially active materials [ 97 ]."
PMC10848226,PMC10848226_007,"Establishing the efficacy of these products through well-designed field intervention studies that are informed by lab-based experiments is an exciting subfield of built environment microbiome research and will ultimately lead to better products, building materials, and design techniques in buildings to improve occupant health and well-being."
PMC3329368,PMC3329368_000,"Extracellular purine nucleotides appear capable of regulating plant development, defence and stress responses by acting in part as agonists of plasma membrane calcium channels. Factors stimulating ATP release include wounding, osmotic stress and elicitors. Here we show that exogenous abscisic acid and L-glutamate can also cause ATP accumulation around Arabidopsis thaliana roots. Release of ADP from root epidermis would trigger ionotropic receptor-like activity in the plasma membrane, resulting in transient elevation of cytosolic free calcium. Root epidermal protoplasts (expressing aequorin as a cytosolic free calcium reporter) can support an extracellular ADP-induced cytosolic calcium elevation in the presence of an extracellular reductant."
PMC3329368,PMC3329368_001,"This confirms that ADP could elicit calcium-based responses distinct to those of ATP, which have been shown previously to involve production of extracellular reactive oxygen species. Keywords: abscisic acid, ADP, ATP, calcium, channel, glutamate, root Extracellular purine nucleotides can regulate plant cell growth, stress responses, immunity and symbiotic events. 1 , 2 Their activity at the plasma membrane elicits increased production of nitric oxide (NO), activation of NADPH oxidases to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), and transient elevations of cytosolic free calcium ([Ca 2+ ] cyt ). 3 - 9 Although there are no equivalents to animal ionotropic or metabotropic purinoreceptor genes apparent in higher plant genomes, plant responses to extracellular purine nucleotides are sensitive to antagonists of animal purinoceptors."
PMC3329368,PMC3329368_002,"1 , 10 - 12 Arabidopsis thaliana plasma membrane Ca 2+ channel activity was recently found to be activated rapidly by extracellular ADP, consistent with the presence of an ionotropic receptor. 13 Parallels with animal cells also extend to a conserved mechanism of ATP and ADP hydrolysis by extracellular apyrase, 14 plus release of ATP by exocytosis 15 and an ABC transporter. 16 ATP is released at plant wound and growth points, in response to touch, elicitors and hyperosmotic stress imposed by salts. 1 , 17 , 18 Here, wounding, hyperosmotic or sodicity stress resulted in distinct levels and time courses of ATP accumulation around excised roots of A. thaliana ( Fig. 1 )."
PMC3329368,PMC3329368_003,"Recovery of ATP levels to control values was evident at the 30 min time point after wounding but remained significantly elevated in response to abiotic stresses (30 min time point; NaCl, p < 0.001; sorbitol, p < 0.036, Student’s t-test). The stress response hormone abscisic acid (ABA) at 1 and 10 μM also promoted ATP accumulation around excised roots ( Fig. 2A ), albeit to a lower level. Accumulation above the ethanol control was significant for both concentrations at 10 and 15 min. Application of 10 μM ABA inhibits A. thaliana primary root growth, a response involving a plasma membrane NADPH oxidase and plasma membrane proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinase (PERK4). 19 , 20 PERK4 directs the activation of plasma membrane Ca 2+ influx channels."
PMC3329368,PMC3329368_004,"20 As extracellular ATP activates root epidermal plasma membrane Ca 2+ influx channels via activation of an NADPH oxidase, it becomes feasible that ABA inhibition involves ATP release and sensing upstream of NADPH oxidases and PERKs, resulting in an inhibitory Ca 2+ influx. High [Ca 2+ ] cyt can act as a “brake” to root hair elongation and perhaps this may also hold for elongation of primary roots. 21 Production of ROS by NADPH oxidases also promotes root cell elongation by activating plasma membrane Ca 2+ channels. 22 Thus, the dose-dependent stimulation or inhibition of growth by extracellular ATP may be effected by the levels of ROS production and channel activation."

PMC4035928,PMC4035928_000,"Their sessile lifestyle means that plants have to be exquisitely sensitive to their environment, integrating many signals to appropriate developmental and physiological responses. Stimuli ranging from wounding and pathogen attack to the distribution of water and nutrients in the soil are frequently presented in a localized manner but responses are often elicited throughout the plant. Such systemic signaling is thought to operate through the redistribution of a host of chemical regulators including peptides, RNAs, ions, metabolites, and hormones. However, there are hints of a much more rapid communication network that has been proposed to involve signals ranging from action and system potentials to reactive oxygen species. We now show that plants also possess a rapid stress signaling system based on Ca 2+ waves that propagate through the plant at rates of up to ∼400 µm/s."
PMC4035928,PMC4035928_001,"In the case of local salt stress to the Arabidopsis thaliana root, Ca 2+ wave propagation is channeled through the cortex and endodermal cell layers and this movement is dependent on the vacuolar ion channel TPC1. We also provide evidence that the Ca 2+ wave/TPC1 system likely elicits systemic molecular responses in target organs and may contribute to whole-plant stress tolerance. These results suggest that, although plants do not have a nervous system, they do possess a sensory network that uses ion fluxes moving through defined cell types to rapidly transmit information between distant sites within the organism. Plants are constantly tailoring their responses to current environmental conditions via a complex array of chemical regulators that integrate developmental and physiological programs across the plant body."
PMC4035928,PMC4035928_002,"Environmental stimuli are often highly localized in nature, but the subsequent plant response is often elicited throughout the entire organism. For example, soil is a highly heterogeneous environment and the root encounters stimuli that are presented in a patchy manner. Thus, factors including dry or waterlogged regions of the soil, variations in the osmotic environment, and stresses such as elevated levels of salt are all likely to be encountered locally by individual root tips, but the information may have to be acted on by the plant as a whole. In animals, long-range signaling to integrate activities across the organism occurs through rapid ionic/membrane potential-driven signaling through the nervous system in addition to operating via long-distance chemical signaling."
PMC4035928,PMC4035928_003,"Plants have also been proposed to possess a rapid, systemic communication network, potentially mediated through signals ranging from changes in membrane potential/ion fluxes ( 1 – 3 ) and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) ( 4 , 5 ) to altered hydraulics in the vasculature ( 6 ). Even so, the molecular mechanisms behind rapid, systemic signaling in plants and whether such signals indeed carry regulatory information remains largely unknown. Suggestions that Ca 2+ channels play a role in signals that occlude sieve tube elements ( 7 ), or that mediate systemic electrical signaling ( 2 ) in response to remote wounding, highlight Ca 2+ -dependent signaling events as a strong candidate for mediating some of these long-range responses."
PMC4035928,PMC4035928_004,"Similarly, cooling of roots elicits Ca 2+ increases in the shoot within minutes ( 8 ), suggesting systemic signals can elicit Ca 2+ -dependent responses at distal sites within the plant. However, despite extensive characterization of Ca 2+ signals (reviewed in ref. 9 ), their roles in a possible plant-wide communication network remain poorly understood. Therefore, to visualize how Ca 2+ might act in local and systemic signaling, we generated Arabidopsis plants expressing the highly sensitive, GFP-based, cytoplasmic Ca 2+ sensor YCNano-65 ( 10 ). We observed that a range of abiotic stresses including H 2 O 2 , touch, NaCl, and cold shock triggered Ca 2+ increases at the point of application. However, NaCl also elicited a Ca 2+ increase that moved away from the point of stress application."
PMC4035928,PMC4035928_005,"Propagation of this Ca 2+ increase was associated with subsequent systemic changes in gene expression. We also report that this salt stress-induced long-distance Ca 2+ wave is dependent on the activity of the ion channel protein Two Pore Channel 1 (TPC1), which also appears to contribute to whole-plant stress tolerance."

PMC5181587,PMC5181587_000,"Gravitropism in Arabidopsis shoots depends on the sedimentation of amyloplasts in the endodermis, and a complex interplay between the vacuole and F-actin. Gravity response is inhibited in zigzag-1 ( zig-1 ), a mutant allele of VTI11 , which encodes a SNARE protein involved in vacuole fusion. zig-1 seedlings have fragmented vacuoles that fuse after treatment with wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and underscore a role of phosphoinositides in vacuole fusion. Using live-cell imaging with a vertical stage microscope, we determined that young endodermal cells below the apical hook that are smaller than 70 μm in length are the graviperceptive cells in dark-grown hypocotyls. This result was confirmed by local wortmannin application to the top of zig-1 hypocotyls, which enhanced shoot gravitropism in zig-1 mutants."
PMC5181587,PMC5181587_001,"Live-cell imaging of zig-1 hypocotyl endodermal cells indicated that amyloplasts are trapped between juxtaposed vacuoles and their movement is severely restricted. Wortmannin-induced fusion of vacuoles in zig-1 seedlings increased the formation of transvacuolar strands, enhanced amyloplast sedimentation and partially suppressed the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1 seedlings. Hypergravity conditions at 10 g were not sufficient to displace amyloplasts in zig-1 , suggesting the existence of a physical tether between the vacuole and amyloplasts. Our results overall suggest that vacuole membrane remodeling may be involved in regulating the association of vacuoles and amyloplasts during graviperception."
PMC4936552,PMC4936552_000,"Plants exhibit rapid, systemic signaling systems that allow them to coordinate physiological and developmental responses throughout the plant body, even to highly localized and quickly changing environmental stresses. The propagation of these signals is thought to include processes ranging from electrical and hydraulic networks to waves of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and cytoplasmic Ca 2+ traveling throughout the plant. For the Ca 2+ wave system, the involvement of the vacuolar ion channel TWO PORE CHANNEL1 (TPC1) has been reported. However, the precise role of this channel and the mechanism of cell-to-cell propagation of the wave have remained largely undefined. Here, we use the fire-diffuse-fire model to analyze the behavior of a Ca 2+ wave originating from Ca 2+ release involving the TPC1 channel in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana )."
PMC4936552,PMC4936552_001,"We conclude that a Ca 2+ diffusion-dominated calcium-induced calcium-release mechanism is insufficient to explain the observed wave transmission speeds. The addition of a ROS -triggered element, however, is able to quantitatively reproduce the observed transmission characteristics. The treatment of roots with the ROS scavenger ascorbate and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyliodonium and analysis of Ca 2+ wave propagation in the Arabidopsis respiratory burst oxidase homolog D ( AtrbohD ) knockout background all led to reductions in Ca 2+ wave transmission speeds consistent with this model. Furthermore, imaging of extracellular ROS production revealed a systemic spread of ROS release that is dependent on both AtRBOHD and TPC1 ."
PMC4936552,PMC4936552_002,"These results suggest that, in the root, plant systemic signaling is supported by a ROS -assisted calcium-induced calcium-release mechanism intimately involving ROS production by AtRBOHD and Ca 2+ release dependent on the vacuolar channel TPC1. Plants possess a rapid systemic signaling network that enables whole-plant responses to localized stimuli. Examples include wounding ( Miller et al., 2009 ), pathogen attack ( Dempsey and Klessig, 2012 ), and osmotic shock ( Christmann et al., 2007 )."
PMC4936552,PMC4936552_003,"The system(s) involved in the plant-wide propagation of these signals has been proposed to be mediated by a diverse set of molecular regulators, including changes in membrane potential and ion fluxes ( Felle and Zimmermann, 2007 ; Zimmermann et al., 2009 ; Mousavi et al., 2013 ), hydraulics in the vasculature ( Christmann et al., 2007 ; Farmer et al., 2014 ), and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ; Miller et al., 2009 ). A novel addition to this suite of systemic signals was described by Choi et al. (2014) , in which a wave-like propagation of increased cytoplasmic Ca 2+ moved throughout the plant in response to localized salt stress. This signal propagated through the roots at a velocity of 396 ± 28 μm s −1 and induced the expression of a range of stress-response genes in the leaves."
PMC4936552,PMC4936552_004,"Unlike systemic signals described previously, this Ca 2+ wave preferentially propagates through the root cortical and endodermal cells rather than the vasculature ( Choi et al., 2014 ). Furthermore, the velocity of the signal is slower than the reported speed of 800 to 1,400 μm s −1 seen with the other proposed systemic signals, such as the ROS wave or electrical coupling ( Miller et al., 2009 ; Mousavi et al., 2013 ). Choi et al. (2014) revealed that the Ca 2+ wave could be blocked by the application of pharmacological agents (La 3+ and Ruthenium Red) known to inhibit calcium-release pathways and that disruption of the TWO PORE CHANNEL1 ( TPC1 ) gene results in a substantial drop in wave speed ( Table I ). Furthermore, overexpression of TPC1 increased the speed of the wave by a factor of 1.7 ( Table I )."
PMC4936552,PMC4936552_005,"TPC1 also appears to be involved in systemic wound-related Ca 2+ increases ( Kiep et al., 2015 ), yet for many stress responses, whole-plant Ca 2+ signaling dynamics appear unchanged in TPC1 mutants ( Ranf et al., 2008 )."

Here, we report that tissue-specific expression of RBOHD in phloem or xylem parenchyma cells of the rbohD mutant restores systemic ROS signaling, systemic stress-response transcript expression, and SAA to a local treatment of light stress. We further demonstrate that RBOHD and RBOHF are both required for local and systemic ROS signaling at the vascular bundles of Arabidopsis."

However, the role of calcium in vivo during biotic stress is still unclear. This protocol describes the use of a genetically-encoded calcium sensor to detect calcium signals in plants during feeding by a hemipteran pest. Hemipterans such as aphids pierce a small number of cells with specialized, elongated sucking mouthparts, making them the ideal tool to study calcium dynamics when a plant is faced with a biotic stress, which is distinct from a wounding response. In addition, fluorescent biosensors are revolutionizing the measurement of signaling molecules in vivo in both animals and plants."

This reveals a highly-localized rapid calcium elevation around the aphid feeding site that occurs within a few minutes. The protocol can be adapted to other biotic stresses, such as additional insect species, while the use of Arabidopsis thaliana allows for the rapid generation of mutants to facilitate the molecular analysis of the phenomenon.

A wide range of signaling molecules are trafficked through the plant, but a trio of potentially interacting messengers, reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca 2+ and electrical signaling (‘trio signaling’) appear to form a network supporting rapid signal transmission. The molecular components underlying this rapid communication are beginning to be identified, such as the ROS producing NAPDH oxidase RBOHD, the ion channel two pore channel 1 (TPC1), and glutamate receptor-like channels GLR3.3 and GLR3.6.

However, analyses that mine across such expanses of data are often complex to implement, being impeded by the sheer number of potential comparisons that are possible. Complexities in how the output of these multiple parallel analyses can be presented to the researcher in an accessible and intuitive form provides further barriers to such research."

We have therefore developed the Test Of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST) database ( https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast ) to address this gap in our capabilities. TOAST is a relational database that uses the Qlik database management software to link plant biology, spaceflight-related omics datasets, and their associated metadata.

PMC7414185,PMC7414185_000,"One of the major events of early plant immune responses is a rapid influx of Ca 2+ into the cytosol following pathogen recognition. Indeed, changes in cytosolic Ca 2+ are recognized as ubiquitous elements of cellular signaling networks and are thought to encode stimulus-specific information in their duration, amplitude, and frequency. Despite the wealth of observations showing that the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22 triggers Ca 2+ transients, there remain limited data defining the molecular identities of Ca 2+ transporters involved in shaping the cellular Ca 2+ dynamics during the triggering of the defense response network. However, the autoinhibited Ca 2+ -ATPase (ACA) pumps that act to expel Ca 2+ from the cytosol have been linked to these events, with knockouts in the vacuolar members of this family showing hypersensitive lesion-mimic phenotypes."
PMC7414185,PMC7414185_001,"We have therefore explored how the two tonoplast-localized pumps, ACA4 and ACA11, impact flg22-dependent Ca 2+ signaling and related defense responses. The double-knockout aca4/11 exhibited increased basal Ca 2+ levels and Ca 2+ signals of higher amplitude than wild-type plants. Both the aberrant Ca 2+ dynamics and associated defense-related phenotypes could be suppressed by growing the aca4/11 seedlings at elevated temperatures. Relocalization of ACA8 from its normal cellular locale of the plasma membrane to the tonoplast also suppressed the aca4/11 phenotypes but not when a catalytically inactive mutant was used."
PMC7414185,PMC7414185_002,"These observations indicate that regulation of vacuolar Ca 2+ sequestration is an integral component of plant immune signaling, but also that the action of tonoplast-localized Ca 2+ pumps does not require specific regulatory elements not found in plasma membrane-localized pumps. Plant pathogens are ubiquitous in the environment and plants have evolved sensory systems to recognize their presence and trigger appropriate defense responses. One of the best characterized of these sensing networks is through plasma membrane localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). These PRRs bind pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs): That is, conserved molecular signals of pathogen presence, such as bacterial flagellin or fungal chitin."
PMC7414185,PMC7414185_003,"Upon PAMP-binding, the PRRs trigger an immune response termed pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) that can lead to the rapid development of both local and plant-wide defense (systemic acquired resistance) ( 1 ). The best-characterized of the PRRs is the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase flagellin-sensitive 2 (FLS2). This protein acts with a coreceptor, BAK1, and is responsible for recognizing bacterial flagellin (or minimally the flg22 peptide epitope within flagellin) ( 2 , 3 ) and triggers the signaling systems that lead to PTI. Induction of these local and systemic responses involves the activation of myriad cellular signaling events at sites of pathogen perception, such as protein phosphorylation cascades, production of reactive oxygen species, anion fluxes, and apoplastic alkalization ( 1 , 4 – 6 )."
PMC7414185,PMC7414185_004,"One of these major hallmarks of early PTI responses is a rapid influx of Ca 2+ into the cytosol immediately after PAMP recognition. The subsequent change in cytosolic Ca 2+ level is then thought to play a role in triggering downstream responses ( 7 – 9 ). Indeed, changes in cytosolic Ca 2+ are recognized as ubiquitous elements of cellular signaling networks and are thought to encode stimulus-specific information in their duration, amplitude, and frequency: Their so-called “calcium signature” ( 10 ). Calcium signatures are determined by an interplay between Ca 2+ permeable channels, exchangers, and pumps ( 11 ). Two cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs 2 and 4) have emerged as likely key players in the Ca 2+ influx supporting the flg22-triggered signaling system under nonlimiting soil Ca 2+ levels ( 12 )."
PMC7414185,PMC7414185_005,"However, other channels are likely also involved as the cngc2/4 double mutant attenuates, but does not abolish, the flg22-induced Ca 2+ change. Similarly, although CNGC2 and -4 are thought to mediate Ca 2+ influx at the plasma membrane, whether release from internal Ca 2+ stores plays a major role in these signaling events remains to be fully characterized. Despite this important role for channels in generating such defense-related Ca 2+ signals, building evidence also suggests an important role for Ca 2+ efflux pumps in innate immune Ca 2+ signaling. In particular, mutants of P2B-type ATPases, or autoinhibited calcium ATPases (ACAs) ( 13 ), have been shown to exhibit aberrant patterns of PTI ( 14 , 15 ). Thus, mutants in the Arabidopsis plasma membrane ACAs, ACA8 and ACA10, show impaired defense and attenuated flg22-induced Ca 2+ signals."
PMC7414185,PMC7414185_006,"Conversely, disruption of the tonoplast ACAs, ACA4 and ACA11, renders plants to be constitutively defense responsive, but whether these phenotypes are related to aberrations in Ca 2+ signaling remains unknown ( 14 ). We report that aca4/11 mutants show elevated basal Ca 2+ and an increased Ca 2+ signal in response to flg22. Elevated temperature is known to suppress defense-response phenotypes and growth at high temperatures rescued both the altered Ca 2+ dynamics and aberrant downstream pathogen responses. Furthermore, we report that the relocalization of a plasma membrane ACA (ACA8) to the tonoplast rescues the aca4/11 phenotype. These observations imply that tonoplast-localized Ca 2+ pumping is integral to maintaining homeostatic Ca 2+ levels and for the initiation of proper PTI responses."
PMC7414185,PMC7414185_007,"However, because the relocalized plasma membrane pump can rescue the tonoplast knockout phenotypes, any regulatory motifs specific to the tonoplast pumps may not be required to support normal Ca 2+ signaling in the flg22-triggered response network."
PMC8133610,PMC8133610_000,"Plants possess a systemic signaling system whereby local stimuli can lead to rapid, plant-wide responses. In addition to the redistribution of chemical messengers that range from RNAs and peptides to hormones and metabolites, a communication system acting through the transmission of electrical, Ca2+, reactive oxygen species and potentially even hydraulic signals has also been discovered. This latter system can propagate signals across many cells each second and researchers are now beginning to uncover the molecular machineries behind this rapid communications network. Thus, elements such as the reactive oxygen species producing NAPDH oxidases and ion channels of the two pore channel, glutamate receptor-like and cyclic nucleotide gated families are all required for the rapid propagation of these signals."
PMC8133610,PMC8133610_001,"Upon arrival at their distant targets, these changes trigger responses ranging from the production of hormones, to changes in the levels of primary metabolites and shifts in patterns of gene expression. These systemic responses occur within seconds to minutes of perception of the initial, local signal, allowing for the rapid deployment of plant-wide responses. For example, an insect starting to chew on just a single leaf triggers preemptive antiherbivore defenses throughout the plant well before it has a chance to move on to the next leaf on its menu. Plants have evolved a complex series of local and systemic signaling systems that allow the integration and coordination of their physiology and development. As early as the 1920s we knew that some of the most rapid of responses, such as the leaflet movements in Mimosa, are associated with electrical changes ( Snow, 1923 ; Houwink, 1935 )."
PMC8133610,PMC8133610_002,"We are now finding similar kinds of rapid, systemic signaling systems in a wide variety of plants operating in response to stimuli ranging from the leaf wounding caused by insect herbivory to local high-light stress. Although APs and VPs are intimately linked to plasma membrane-related events, reflecting as they do ion movements across this membrane, the important roles of the vacuolar ion channel TPC1 and the potential for GLRs located on intracellular membranes such as the tonoplast and ER in systemic signaling highlight the likely role of organelles in propagating these events. Both the ER and the vacuole are emerging as important signaling hubs in plants ( Peiter, 2011 ; Schönknecht, 2013 ; Liu and Li, 2019 ) and we can expect that an intricate set of interactions between these organelles and the plasma membrane are going to be important in systemic signal propagation."
PMC8133610,PMC8133610_003,"Defining which channels are acting where, their orientations, and what ion fluxes they support are clearly key pieces of information still needed to understand the mechanisms underlying signal propagation. For example, a plasma membrane locale of the relevant GLRs fits well with the idea of the amino acid glutamate being a trigger for systemic wound responses ( Toyota et al., 2018 ). In this model, cellular damage causes leakage of glutamate to the apoplast that then triggers GLR action and supports the Ca 2+ fluxes involved in systemic signal propagation. Consistent with these ideas, in a GLR3.3 - and GLR3.6 -dependent manner, local application of glutamate can trigger both systemic spread of a Ca 2+ increase and activation of JA defense responses throughout the plant ( Toyota et al., 2018 ). How then do GLRs on the organelles play roles in this system?"
PMC8133610,PMC8133610_004,"Where do the ligand binding sites face? Are there cytoplasmic amino acid ligands in operation or is some other gating mechanism at play? Despite some major advances in defining molecular mechanisms in the last few years, our models of these systemic signaling events are clearly still far from complete (see Outstanding Questions). Other major open questions are whether or not a simple Ca 2+ /RBOH feedforward loop is sufficient to explain rapid, systemic signal propagation or whether there are multiple signaling networks tuned to specific stimuli. How central is the vasculature as a highway for these signals and do such systems operate in concert with a rapid hydraulic communication network? We are only just beginning to dissect the molecular underpinnings of this electrical, ROS-based, ionic, and hydraulic systemic signaling system(s), but we do know one thing already, it is fast."

Comparing wild-type and cax1 expressing genetically encoded Ca indicators demonstrated altered cytosolic Ca signals in cax1 during reoxygenation. Anoxia-induced Ca signals around the plant vacuole are involved in the control of numerous signaling events related to adaptation to low oxygen stress. This work suggests that cax1 anoxia response pathway could be engineered to circumvent the adverse effects of flooding that impair production agriculture. Plants lacking a vacuolar H + /Ca transporter are more tolerant to anoxia and submergence."
PMC9706465,PMC9706465_002,"This study adds granularity to the role of tonoplast localized Ca transport in plant stress responses. The cax1- mediated anoxia tolerance is caused by extensive changes in both metabolism and signaling. Indeed, one of the most important findings of this study is the breath and amplitude of changes caused by the loss of a single tonoplast H + /Ca transporter ( Figures 5 and 6 ). To harness this knowledge for translational applications, judicious application is advised: CAX transporters impact a variety of plant signal transduction pathways ( Pittman and Hirschi, 2016 ; Bradshaw, 2005 ; Baliardini et al., 2015 , 2016 ). However, the CAX transporters appear to be autoinhibited, requiring a protein partner for activation ( Shigaki and Hirschi, 2006 )."

However, select immune and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses were differentially impacted by the HU social environment relative to matched NL controls.

This modification occurs at high frequency at position 37 of most tRNAs that decode ANN codons, and stabilizes cognate anticodon–codon interactions. Nearly all genetic studies of the t6A pathway have focused on single-celled organisms. In this study, we report the isolation of an extensive allelic series in the Drosophila ortholog of the core t6A biosynthesis factor Kae1. kae1 hemizygous larvae exhibit decreases in t6A that correlate with allele strength; however, we still detect substantial t6A-modified tRNAs even during the extended larval phase of null alleles. Nevertheless, complementation of Drosophila Kae1 and other t6A factors in corresponding yeast null mutants demonstrates that these metazoan genes execute t6A synthesis."
PMC4647464,PMC4647464_001,"Turning to the biological consequences of t6A loss, we characterize prominent kae1 melanotic masses and show that they are associated with lymph gland overgrowth and ectopic generation of lamellocytes. On the other hand, kae1 mutants exhibit other phenotypes that reflect insufficient tissue growth. Interestingly, whole-tissue and clonal analyses show that strongly mitotic tissues such as imaginal discs are exquisitely sensitive to loss of kae1 , whereas nonproliferating tissues are less affected. Indeed, despite overt requirements of t6A for growth of many tissues, certain strong kae1 alleles achieve and sustain enlarged body size during their extended larval phase. Our studies highlight tissue-specific requirements of the t6A pathway in a metazoan context and provide insights into the diverse biological roles of this fundamental RNA modification during animal development and disease."

PMC5659752,PMC5659752_000,"The evolutionary success of parasitoid wasps, a highly diverse group of insects widely used in biocontrol, depends on a variety of life history strategies in conflict with those of their hosts [ 1 ]. Drosophila melanogaster is a natural host of parasitic wasps of the genus Leptopilina . Attack by L. boulardi ( Lb ), a specialist wasp to flies of the melanogaster group, activates NF-κB-mediated humoral and cellular immunity. Inflammatory blood cells mobilize and encapsulate Lb eggs and embryos [ 2 – 5 ]. L. heterotoma ( Lh ), a generalist wasp, kills larval blood cells and actively suppresses immune responses. Spiked virus-like particles (VLPs) in wasp venom have clearly been linked to its successful parasitism of Drosophila [ 6 ], but VLP composition and their biotic nature have remained mysterious."
PMC5659752,PMC5659752_001,"Our proteomics studies reveal that VLPs lack viral coat proteins but possess a pharmacopoeia of (a) eukaryotic vesicular transport system, (b) immunity, and (c) previously unknown proteins. These novel proteins distinguish Lh from Lb VLPs; notably, some proteins specific to Lh VLPs possess sequence similarities with bacterial secretion system proteins. Structure-informed analyses of an abundant Lh VLP surface/spike-tip protein, p40, reveal similarities to the needle-tip invasin proteins SipD/IpaD of Gram negative bacterial type 3 secretion systems that breach immune barriers and deliver virulence factors into mammalian cells. Our studies suggest that Lh VLPs represent a new class of extracellular organelles and share pathways for protein delivery with both eukaryotic microvesicles and bacterial surface secretion systems."

Here we use systematic and comprehensive bioinformatics approaches to identify most of the mammalian eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. Sensitive sequence analysis techniques identified candidate Drosophila enzymes that share low global sequence identities with their human counterparts. Twenty Drosophila candidates were selected based upon (a) sequence identity with human enzymes of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase branches, (b) similar domain architecture and structural conservation of the catalytic domain, and (c) presence of potentially equivalent functional residues."

Our findings predict that the D . melanogaster genome likely codes for one or more pathways for eicosanoid or eicosanoid-like biolipid synthesis. Our study suggests that classical and/or novel eicosanoids mediators must regulate biological functions in insects–predictions that can be tested with the power of Drosophila genetics.

While the crucial immune suppressive functions of L. heterotoma MSEVs have remained undisputed, their biotic nature and origin still remain controversial. In recent proteomics analyses of L. heterotoma MSEVs, we identified 161 proteins in three classes: conserved eukaryotic proteins, infection and immunity related proteins, and proteins without clear annotation. Here we report 246 additional proteins from the L. heterotoma MSEV proteome. An enrichment analysis of the entire proteome supports vesicular nature of these structures."

Altogether, these results explain the stable association of MSEVs with their wasps, and like other wasp structures, their vertical inheritance. While our results do not rule out a viral origin of MSEVs, they suggest that a similar strategy for co-opting cellular machinery for immune suppression may be shared by other wasps to gain advantage over their hosts. These results are relevant to our understanding of the evolution of figitid and related wasp species."
PMC6945029,PMC6945029_002,"Keywords: Extracellular vesicle, whole genome sequencing, Leptopilina heterotoma , endoparasitoid wasp, Drosophila , VLP, host-parasite, organelle, immune suppression Parasitic wasps are among the most abundant insects; they are vital to biodiversity and contribute to biological control of agricultural pests ( Narendran 2001 ; Rodriguez et al. 2013 ). A common strategy for reproductive success of parasitic wasps is suppression of immunity in their larval hosts. Parasitic wasps produce viruses or virus-like particles in tissues associated with the ovary. Wasps of the Ichneumonoidea superfamily produce symbiotic polydnaviruses (PDVs), which package circular dsDNA. PDV (Bracovirus (BV) in braconid wasps; Ichnovirus (IV) in ichneumonid wasps) genomes are integrated within the wasp genome as islands of viral genes. Upon oviposition, PDVs suppress host immunity."
PMC6945029,PMC6945029_003,"BVs and IVs derive from nudivirus and large DNA cytoplasmic viruses, respectively (reviewed in Strand and Burke 2015 ; Drezen et al. 2017 ; Gauthier et al. 2018 , and references therein). Immune-suppressive virus-like particles (VLPs) ( e.g. , VcVLPs in the ichneumonid Venturia canescens and FaENVs in the braconid Fopius arisanus ) lack proviral DNA segments, but are of viral origin and transfer virulence proteins into host cells ( Pichon et al. 2015 ; Burke et al. 2018 ). Viral genes encoding VLP proteins are either dispersed in the wasp genome (as in VcVLP) or present in discrete genomic areas (as in FaENV). Thus, various independent viral endogenization events have been important for successful parasitism by these wasps ( Strand and Burke 2015 ; Gauthier et al. 2018 )."
PMC6945029,PMC6945029_004,"Here, we focus on immune-suppressive particles of figitid wasps in the genus Leptopilina , that infect Drosophila spp. and are gaining importance as models for natural host-parasite interactions ( Keebaugh and Schlenke 2014 ). Leptopilina heterotoma ( Lh ), L. victoriae ( Lv ), and L. boulardi ( Lb ) produce VLPs in their venom glands. The VLPs of Leptopilina spp. and their proteins have been linked to parasite success ( Rizki et al. 1990 ; Dupas et al. 1996 ; Morales et al. 2005 ; Labrosse et al. 2005 ; Chiu et al. 2006 ; Heavner et al. 2014 ). Evidence for DNA in Leptopilina VLPs is lacking, and because of the absence of a published wasp genome, the chromosomal vs. extrachromosomal location of MSEV protein genes is not known."
PMC6945029,PMC6945029_005,"Our goals here are (a) to describe additional proteins in the MSEV proteome and examine their relationship with PDV and other viral proteins, and (b) determine whether MSEV genes are encoded in the wasp genome. We recently described 161 proteins in the VLPs from two Lh strains in three classes: conserved eukaryotic with cellular function (Class 1), infection- and immunity-related (Class 2), and unannotated (novel) without similarity to known proteins (Class 3) ( Heavner et al. 2017 ). Class 1 proteins include several vesicular transport and endomembrane system proteins. Class 2 proteins include predicted modulators of immune response, e.g. , metalloendopeptidases, RhoGAPs, a knottin-like protein, and a new family of prokaryotic-like GTPases whose genes lack introns."
PMC6945029,PMC6945029_006,"A striking example of Class 3 proteins is p40, with three-dimensional structural similarity to Type 3 secretion system (T3SS) needle-tip proteins, IpaD/SipD/BipD from Gram-negative bacteria, Salmonella , Shigella and Burkholderia . Earlier results have indicated that the p40 gene (unlike the GTPase genes) is expected to have introns. These results suggested that Lh VLPs have novel properties with elements of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic secretion systems and possess a functionally diverse array of immune-suppressive proteins. We therefore renamed VLPs as Mixed Strategy Extracellular Vesicles (MSEVs). Their variable morphologies distinguish them from ordered PDV morphologies. Additionally, genes encoding abundant MSEV proteins p40 and GTPase are present even in antibiotic-treated wasps. These results favored a non-microbial nature for MSEVs ( Heavner et al. 2017 )."

A combined analysis of these and previous results reinforce the idea that the MSEV proteome is enriched in exosomal proteins and that Class 3 proteins are not shared with either Lb or an unrelated Ganaspis spp. Whole-body transcriptome of adult Lh wasps validated the expression of the MSEV genes. De novo genomic assembly and analyses revealed 90% of conserved Insecta Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCOs), as well as a majority (375/407; ∼90%) of the MSEV proteins are encoded in the wasp genome."

Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are significantly influenced by spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of S. marcescens did not persist after the bacterial cultures were passaged on the ground."

Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later timepoints spaceflight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls in vitro, and in the host.

PMC8191917,PMC8191917_000,"The wasps Leptopilina heterotoma parasitize and ingest their Drosophila hosts. They produce extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the venom that are packed with proteins, some of which perform immune suppressive functions. EV interactions with blood cells of host larvae are linked to hematopoietic depletion, immune suppression, and parasite success. But how EVs disperse within the host, enter and kill hematopoietic cells is not well understood. Using an antibody marker for L . heterotoma EVs, we show that these parasite-derived structures are readily distributed within the hosts’ hemolymphatic system. EVs converge around the tightly clustered cells of the posterior signaling center (PSC) of the larval lymph gland, a small hematopoietic organ in Drosophila . The PSC serves as a source of developmental signals in naïve animals."
PMC8191917,PMC8191917_001,"In wasp-infected animals, the PSC directs the differentiation of lymph gland progenitors into lamellocytes. These lamellocytes are needed to encapsulate the wasp egg and block parasite development. We found that L . heterotoma infection disassembles the PSC and PSC cells disperse into the disintegrating lymph gland lobes. Genetically manipulated PSC-less lymph glands remain non-responsive and largely intact in the face of L . heterotoma infection. We also show that the larval lymph gland progenitors use the endocytic machinery to internalize EVs. Once inside, L . heterotoma EVs damage the Rab7- and LAMP-positive late endocytic and phagolysosomal compartments. Rab5 maintains hematopoietic and immune quiescence as Rab5 knockdown results in hematopoietic over-proliferation and ectopic lamellocyte differentiation."
PMC8191917,PMC8191917_002,"Thus, both aspects of anti-parasite immunity, i.e., (a) phagocytosis of the wasp’s immune-suppressive EVs, and (b) progenitor differentiation for wasp egg encapsulation reside in the lymph gland. These results help explain why the lymph gland is specifically and precisely targeted for destruction. The parasite’s simultaneous and multipronged approach to block cellular immunity not only eliminates blood cells, but also tactically blocks the genetic programming needed for supplementary hematopoietic differentiation necessary for host success. In addition to its known functions in hematopoiesis, our results highlight a previously unrecognized phagocytic role of the lymph gland in cellular immunity.

To overcome the resistance of their hosts, parasitic wasps use varied and ingenious strategies such as mimicry, evasion, bioactive venom, virus-like particles, viruses, and extracellular vesicles (EVs). We describe the effects of a unique class of EVs containing virulence proteins and produced in the venom of wasps that parasitize fruit flies of Drosophila species. EVs from Leptopilina heterotoma are widely distributed throughout the Drosophila hosts’ circulatory system after infection."
PMC8191917,PMC8191917_004,"They enter and kill macrophages by destroying the very same subcellular machinery that facilitates their uptake. An important protein in this process, Rab5, is needed to maintain the identity of the macrophage; when Rab5 function is reduced, macrophages turn into a different cell type called lamellocytes. Activities in the EVs can eliminate lamellocytes as well. EVs also interfere with the hosts’ genetic program that promotes lamellocyte differentiation needed to block parasite development. Thus, wasps combine specific preemptive and reactive strategies to deplete their hosts of the very cells that would otherwise sequester and kill them. These findings have applied value in agricultural pest control and medical therapeutics."

Our structural and docking analysis of LhKNOT’s 36-residue core knottin fold revealed that in addition to the knottin motif itself, it also possesses a Cation–Polar–Cation (CPC) clip. The CPC clip motif is thought to facilitate antimicrobial activity in heparin-binding proteins."

Like LhKNOT and these other 75 knottin proteins, even the Drosophila Drosomycin antifungal peptide, a canonical target gene of the fly’s Toll-NF-kappa B immune pathway, contains this CPC clip motif. Together, our results suggest a possible defensive function for the parasitoid LhKNOT. The prevalence of the CPC clip motif, intrinsic to the cysteine knot within the knottin proteins examined here, suggests that the resultant 3D topology is important for their biochemical functions.

Clinical data on the appropriate use of liposomal-amphotericin B (liposomal-AmB) with cryptococcal meningitis are limited. Here, we report for the first time the efficacious and safe use of the ideal bodyweight to calculate the dose of liposomal-AmB for a severely obese patient with C albidus meningitis. We also review the cases of CNS infection caused by C albidus and its related species. A severely obese female patient was admitted to neurosurgical ward with lesions in the intracranial space and accompanying headache. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed prominent lesions in the right parietal and left frontal insular region. After glioma resection, C albidus was isolated from her cerebrospinal fluid samples."

The culture from her cerebrospinal fluid sample showed the growth of yeast-like colonies, which were identified as C albidus with mass spectrometry. She was treated with liposomal-AmB (50 mg day -1 intravenously) plus 5-fluorocytosine (10 g day -1 orally in 4 divided doses) for 6 weeks. The patient was asymptomatic at the time of discharge. CNS infections of C albidus were uncommon. Using ideal bodyweight to calculate the dose of liposomal-AmB should be considered for severely obese patients with C albidus meningitis.

BUN = blood urea nitrogen, Scr = serum creatinine. C albidus in the genus Cryptococcus , is a rare species that causes cryptococcal infections, especially in the CNS infections. The antifungal treatment recommended for cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is liposomal-AmB plus flucytosine.

To date, the calculation of the appropriate dose for severely obese patients is controversial. [ 13 , 14 ] Animal studies have demonstrated significantly increased AmB serum concentrations and increased rates of nephrotoxicity in obese rats and rabbits, with poor distribution of adipose tissue. [ 15 ] Furthermore, women have a higher body fat rate than men, which is a risk factor for acute kidney injury caused by liposomal-AmB. [ 16 ] Therefore, it may be reasonable to consider the ideal bodyweight rather than the actual bodyweight when calculating the dose of liposomal-AmB for severely obese female patients."

Because these fungi are infrequent causes of disease, there are no evidence-based guidelines or standard recommendations for their treatment. The susceptibility of C albidus and its related species to antifungal agents is shown in Table 3 . The cumulative experience reported in the published literature suggests that AmB is the only agent to which C albidus and its related species are consistently sensitive. [ 45 , 46 ] Therefore, AmB is a safe and effective drug for use as initial induction therapy against these infections in the CNS."

To date, no randomized controlled trials have been conducted to optimize the choice of AmB or the duration of its therapy. We recommend: (1) using liposomal-AmB instead of AmB deoxycholate because liposomal-AmB is safer and more rapidly sterilizes the CSF than AmB deoxycholate [ 11 , 12 , 32 ] ; (2) at least 1 g of AmB during treatment and prolonged treatment are recommended.

Based on the systematic review of CNS infections of C albidus and its related species, we also concluded that leukemia and cancer are important risk factors for these infections and that headache is the most frequent symptom. The identification of fungal pathogens requires the analysis the rRNA sequences because many species share phenotypic similarities.

Eighteen mice were divided into three groups: control, survival box, and clinostat + survival box. Behavioral tests, femur micro-CT, brain transcriptomics, serum metabolomics, and fecal microbiomics were performed. Results showed decreased activity, altered gait, enhanced fear memory, bone loss, immune/endocrine changes in brain transcriptome, and altered metabolic pathways in serum and gut microbiota in clinostat-treated mice.

PMC9146534,PMC9146534_000,"Increased viscosity of concentrated contrast media (CM) in the renal tubules can perturb renal hemodynamics and have a detrimental effect on tubular epithelial cells. However, the effects of viscosity on contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) remain poorly understood. Conventional in vitro culture studies do not reflect the rheological properties of CM. Therefore, we investigated the effects of CM viscosity on renal tubules using a kidney-on-a-chip and two different types of CM. Renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) were cultured in a three-dimensional microfluidic culture platform under bidirectional fluid shear stress. We treated the RPTEC with two types of CM: low- (LOCM, iopromide) and iso-osmolar contrast media (IOCM, iodixanol). Renal tubular cell injury induced by LOCM and IOCM was examined under different iodine concentrations (50–250 mgI/mL) and shear-stress conditions."
PMC9146534,PMC9146534_001,"LOCM showed a significant dose-dependent cytotoxic effect, which was significantly higher than that of IOCM under static and low-to-moderate shear stress conditions. However, high shear-stress resulted in reduced cell viability in IOCM; no difference between IOCM and LOCM was found under high shear-stress conditions. The cytotoxic effects were pronounced at a mean shear stress of 1 dyn/cm 2 or higher. The high viscosity of IOCM slowed the fluid flow rate and augmented fluid shear-stress. We suggest an alternative in vitro model of CIN using the three-dimensional kidney-on-a-chip. Our results indicate a vital role of viscosity-induced nephrotoxicity under high shear-stress conditions, contrary to the findings of conventional in vitro studies.

PMC4110898,PMC4110898_000,"Bone remodeling may occur in spaceflight as a response to skeletal unloading and head-ward fluid shifts. While unloading causes significant loss of bone mass and density in legs of animals exposed to microgravity, increased blood and interstitial fluid flows accompanying microgravity-induced fluid redistribution may elicit an opposite effect in the head. Seven C57BL/6 mice were randomly chosen for exposure to 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 mission, while eight littermates served as ground controls. Upon mission completion, all 15 mice calvariae were imaged on a micro-computed tomography scanner. A standardized rectangular volume was placed on the parietal bones of each calvaria for analyses, and three parameters were determined to measure increased parietal bone volume: bone volume (BV), cross-sectional thickness (CsTh), and tissue mineral density (TMD)."

While bending motions are main contributors to herniation, the effects of microgravity on the bending properties of spinal discs are unknown. Consequently, the goal of this study was to quantify the bending properties of tail discs from mice with or without microgravity exposure. Caudal motion segments from six mice returned from a 30-day Bion M1 mission and eight vivarium controls were loaded to failure in four-point bending. After testing, specimens were processed using histology to determine the location of failure, and adjacent motion segments were scanned with micro-computed tomography (μCT) to quantify bone properties.

Representing non-load bearing regions with mouse calvaria and leveraging the STS-131 (15-day) and BION-M1 (30-day) flights, we examined spatial and temporal calvarial vascular remodeling and gene expression related to microgravity exposure compared between spaceflight (SF) and ground control (GC) cohorts."

We found that the vessel diameter reduces significantly in mice exposed to 15 days of spaceflight relative to control. Capillarization increases by 30% (SF vs. GC, p = 0.054) in SF mice compared to GC mice. The vessel numbers and diameter remain unchanged in BION-M1 mice calvarial section. We next analyzed the parietal pro-angiogenic ( VEGFA ) and pro-osteogenic gene ( BMP-2, DMP1, RUNX2 and OCN ) expression in BION-M1 mice using quantitative RT-PCR. VEGFA gene expression increased 15-fold while BMP-2 gene expression increased 11-fold in flight mice compared to GC."

Future study will also examine the behavior of BMP-2 gene expression levels post-flight, and whether these levels return to baseline prior to euthanasia. These results also suggest that key molecules associated with angiogenesis (VEGFA) and osteogenesis (BMP-2) genes are modulated in BION-M1 mice calvaria exposed to 30 days of microgravity. We suggest that VEGFA and BMP-2 genes are gravity sensors in mouse calvaria.

Astronaut health could therefore be compromised if the spacecraft environment or water becomes contaminated with pathogenic mycobacteria. This work uses Mycobacterium marinum to determine the physiological changes in a pathogenic mycobacteria grown under low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG). M. marinum were grown in high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) using a rotary cell culture system subjected to LSMMG or the control orientation (normal gravity, NG) and the cultures used to determine bacterial growth, bacterium size, transcriptome changes, and resistance to stress.

Results suggest that LSMMG induced a reduction in translation, a downregulation of metabolism, an increase in lipid degradation, and increased chaperone and mycobactin expression. Sigma factor H ( sigH ) was the only sigma factor transcript induced by LSMMG after both short and long exposure times. In summary, transcriptome studies suggest that LSMMG may simulate a nutrient-deprived environment similar to that found within macrophage during infection.

PMC3258067,PMC3258067_000,"Gravitropism describes curvature of plants in response to gravity or differential acceleration and clinorotation is commonly used to compensate unilateral effect of gravity. We report on experiments that examine the persistence of the gravity signal and separate mechanostimulation from gravistimulation. Flax roots were reoriented (placed horizontally for 5, 10 or 15 min) and clinorotated at a rate of 0.5 to 5 rpm either vertically (parallel to the gravity vector and root axis) or horizontally (perpendicular to the gravity vector and parallel to the root axis). Image sequences showed that horizontal clinorotation did not affect root growth rate (0.81 ± 0.03 mm h −1 ) but vertical clinorotation reduced root growth by about 7%. The angular velocity (speed of clinorotation) did not affect growth for either direction."

The data indicate that mechanostimulation modifies the magnitude of the graviresponse but does not affect memory persistence. Key words: mechanostimulation, memory, clinorotation speed and direction, signal persistence, signal saturation Angular velocity and direction interfere with the graviresponse mechanism in roots.

The effect of heat stress was evaluated using morphological changes, photosystem (PS) II efficiency, and metabolic indicators. Pinnae of dried fronds exposed to more than 40°C curled tighter and became brittle compared to fronds dried at lower temperatures. Exposure to > 50°C leads to discolored fronds after rehydration. Hydrated fronds turned partially brown at > 35°C.

We compared tissue extraction of the convex and concave flank with Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE).

PMC9617909,PMC9617909_000,Directing plant growth in weightlessness requires understanding the processes that establish plant orientation and how to manipulate them. Both gravi- and phototropism determine directional growth and previous experiments showed that high gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) can induce curvature in roots and shoots. Experiments with Brassica rapa verified that that gravitropism-like induction of curvature is possible in space and that the HGMF-responsive organelles are amyloplasts. We assessed the effect of space and HGMF based on 16 genes and compared their transcription with static growth and clinorotation. Amyloplasts size in root tips increased under weightlessness but decreased under clinorotation but not in response to magnetic fields. Amyloplast size changes were correlated with reduced amylase transcription in space samples and enhanced transcription after clinorotation.

PMC3503204,PMC3503204_000,"Like many other organisms, plants are capable of sensing and responding to mechanical stimuli such as touch, osmotic pressure, and gravity. One mechanism for the perception of force is the activation of mechanosensitive (or stretch-activated) ion channels, and a number of mechanosensitive channel activities have been described in plant membranes. Based on their homology to the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscS, the 10 MscS-Like (MSL) proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana have been hypothesized to form mechanosensitive channels in plant cell and organelle membranes. However, definitive proof that MSLs form mechanosensitive channels has been lacking. Here we used single-channel patch clamp electrophysiology to show that MSL10 is capable of providing a MS channel activity when heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes."
PMC3503204,PMC3503204_001,"This channel had a conductance of ∼100 pS, consistent with the hypothesis that it underlies an activity previously observed in the plasma membrane of plant root cells. We found that MSL10 formed a channel with a moderate preference for anions, which was modulated by strongly positive and negative membrane potentials, and was reversibly inhibited by gadolinium, a known inhibitor of mechanosensitive channels. MSL10 demonstrated asymmetric activation/inactivation kinetics, with the channel closing at substantially lower tensions than channel opening. The electrophysiological characterization of MSL10 reported here provides insight into the evolution of structure and function of this important family of proteins."
PMC3503204,PMC3503204_002,"The perception of mechanical stimuli like gravity, touch, or osmotic pressure is essential to normal plant growth and development and is further implicated in biotic and abiotic stress responses ( 1 ). One of the best-studied strategies for perceiving force involves membrane-embedded channels that are gated by tension, known as mechanosensitive (MS) channels ( 2 ). Numerous MS channel activities (>17 to date) have been described in the membranes of diverse tissues from a variety of plant species (summarized in ref. 3 , also refs. 4 and 5 ). Many of these observed MS channel activities differ in their conductance, ion selectivity, and/or sensitivity to the direction of activation pressure, suggesting that multiple classes of mechanosensitive channels are present in plant cells."
PMC3503204,PMC3503204_003,"No mechanosensitive ion channel activity discovered in plant membranes has yet been definitively identified at the molecular level, but two families of proteins serve as strong candidates. The first is the Mid1-Complementing Activity (MCA) family, members of which are required for root response to touch in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana , induce Ca 2+ uptake in rice and Arabidopsis cells ( 6 , 7 ), and are associated with increased current in response to hypotonic stimulation of Xenopus oocytes ( 8 ). The second family of candidates for plant MS channels is the MscS-Like (MSL) family, first identified based on modest homology to the well-characterized bacterial MS channel MscS from Escherichia coli ( 3 , 9 ). MscS is a largely nonselective stretch-activated channel that is gated directly by membrane tension, generating a 1-nanoSiemen (nS) conductance (reviewed in refs. 10 and 11 )."
PMC3503204,PMC3503204_004,"The primary function of MscS is to provide a conduit for the release of osmolytes from the bacterium in response to extreme hypoosmotic stress ( 12 , 13 ). There are 10 MscS homologs in Arabidopsis , three with predicted or observed localization to organellar membranes and seven with predicted or observed localization to the plasma and vacuolar membranes ( 3 , 5 , 14 ). Reverse genetic analyses have demonstrated that two plastid-localized homologs, MSL2 and MSL3, are required for the proper size, shape, division, and hypoosmotic volume control of plastids ( 14 – 16 ). In addition, two plasma membrane-localized homologs, MSL9 and MSL10, are genetically required for the predominant MS channel activity in the plasma membrane of Arabidopsis root cell protoplasts, providing support for the hypothesis that MSL proteins form MS channels ( 5 )."
PMC3503204,PMC3503204_005,"A MscS homolog from the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, MSC1, has MS channel activity when expressed in giant E. coli spheroplasts ( 17 ). However, it has been proposed that the contribution of MSL9 and MSL10 to MS channel activity in root protoplasts may be indirect ( 1 ), and a more rigorous test by expression and electrophysiological characterization in a heterologous system is needed. Indeed, it seems likely that MSLs do not form MS channels, because the plasma membrane-localized MscS homologs from plants are highly divergent from MscS with respect to topology and show limited sequence similarity, even within the conserved domain ( Fig. S1 ). Some bacterial MscS homologs do not appear to provide MS channel activities, further suggesting that a subset of the family has evolved to perform diverse functions (reviewed in ref. 18 )."
PMC3503204,PMC3503204_006,"We were thus motivated to develop a system for the electrophysiological investigation of MSL proteins to determine whether eukaryotic plasma membrane-localized MscS homologs indeed form MS channels and, if so, to compare their electrophysiological behavior with that of other MscS homologs.

PMC5896955,PMC5896955_000,"Somatosensory neurons mediate responses to diverse mechanical stimuli, from innocuous touch to noxious pain. While recent studies have identified distinct populations of A mechanonociceptors (AMs) that are required for mechanical pain, the molecular underpinnings of mechanonociception remain unknown. Here, we show that the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and S1P Receptor 3 (S1PR3) are critical regulators of acute mechanonociception. Genetic or pharmacological ablation of S1PR3, or blockade of S1P production, significantly impaired the behavioral response to noxious mechanical stimuli, with no effect on responses to innocuous touch or thermal stimuli. These effects are mediated by fast-conducting A mechanonociceptors, which displayed a significant decrease in mechanosensitivity in S1PR3 mutant mice."

Research organism: Mouse To identify candidate genes underlying mechanosensation, we previously performed transcriptome analysis of the sensory ganglia innervating the ultra-sensitive tactile organ (the star) of the star-nosed mole ( Gerhold et al., 2013 ). Immunostaining revealed the tactile organ is preferentially innervated by myelinated Aδ fibers ( Gerhold et al., 2013 ), which are primarily mechanosensitive. While our original analysis focused on ion channels enriched in the neurons of the star organ, our dataset also revealed enrichment of several components of the S1P pathway, including S1pr3 ."
PMC5896955,PMC5896955_002,"Likewise, single-cell RNA seq of mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons revealed S1pr3 expression in a subset of myelinated mechanoreceptors ( Usoskin et al., 2015 ) in addition to a subpopulation of peptidergic C nociceptors.

In addition, S1PR3 has been shown to mediate spontaneous pain triggered by elevated S1P and thermal sensitization following sterile tissue injury ( Camprubí-Robles et al., 2013 ). However, no studies have examined the role of S1PR3 in mechanosensation or in regulating somatosensory behaviors under normal conditions.

Cell viability and metabolism depend on cytoplasmic water and solute content, and organisms have evolved mechanisms to sense changes in cell water content, solute concentrations, cell volume, and/or turgor. This Perspective addresses the response to osmotic challenge in land plants and describes their special dependence on cellular water status for growth and development. Understanding how plants cope with water limitation may allow us to mitigate the agricultural effects of drought, a critical limitation on global crop productivity that is likely to increase in severity as the climate changes ( Long and Ort, 2010 )."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_002,"The signaling pathways by which plants respond to osmotic challenge are intriguing from an evolutionary standpoint: some aspects of these pathways resemble those of fungal or mammalian cells, some are similar to prokaryotic mechanisms, and yet others are unique to plants (as described below and in Hamann, 2012 ). In addition to the importance of osmotic homeostasis in land plants, we will discuss some of the specific context and language of plant stress biology, and describe what is known (and not known) about the molecular pathways by which plants sense and respond to osmotic challenges. Plants can only take up water from the soil in which they are growing, and are unable to relocate to find more favorable water conditions."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_003,"The majority of the water extracted from the soil by a plant’s roots travels rapidly up the plant through the vascular system, eventually to be lost via regulated pores in the leaf epidermis called stomata. This vertical movement of water within the plant mediates the root-to-shoot movement of nutrients, hormones, and developmental signals. Importantly, open stomata are also the conduits through which gas is exchanged between the leaf and the atmosphere during photosynthesis. Thus, plants must continuously balance the advantages of efficient photosynthesis and solute transport with the drawbacks of water loss through open stomata; how well they accomplish this task contributes to their water use efficiency, a key factor in drought response ( Long and Ort, 2010 )."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_004,"At the cellular level, water is critical for maintaining and controlling an important driving force in plant cells called turgor pressure. Much of a plant cell’s water—and therefore most of its volume—is accounted for by the vacuole (a large intracellular organelle found in plants, fungi, and animals). In plants, the vacuole often takes up >80% of the cell volume, and one of its many functions is to maintain turgor via active transport of ions in and out of the vacuolar space ( Hedrich, 2012 ). The plant cell plasma membrane is surrounded by a strong but elastic cell wall comprised of cellulose microfibrils embedded in a gel of pectin, other carbohydrates, and protein. Turgor pressure is the pressure exerted by the protoplast (all portions of the cell enclosed by the plasma membrane) against the cell wall."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_005,"The amount of turgor pressure in a particular cell is determined by several factors, including the osmotic difference that is generated by vacuolar and cytoplasmic solute accumulation and subsequent water uptake, and the elasticity of the cell wall (see Verslues et al., 2006 , for additional explanation). The turgor pressure of a plant cell can be as high as the pressure of a car tire; high turgor pressure is critical to give plants their rigidity and structure, drive cell expansion, mediate the opening and closing of stomata, and allow movements like the closing of a Venus flytrap ( Pritchard, 2001 ). Strictly defined, the term “osmosensing” refers to the direct perception of the osmolarity of the external or internal environment of a cell."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_006,"This term is often used by plant researchers, but it is entirely possible that mechanical stimuli caused by change in membrane tension, cell wall damage, or the disruption of plasma membrane–cell wall connections are relevant factors in osmosensing, in addition to or instead of altered extracellular osmolarity per se (see Fig. 1 ). For the purposes of this Perspective, “osmosensing” is used to include both the direct perception of osmotic imbalance across a membrane as well as the perception of indirect effects of osmotic imbalance on the membrane, cell wall, or membrane–cell wall system. We anticipate that as the molecular mechanism(s) for the perception of osmotic challenge becomes clearer, so will the terms used to describe these processes. Potential osmosensing mechanisms in plant cells."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_007,"(A) Histidine kinases could be activated by osmotic imbalance across the plasma membrane, initiating a signal transduction pathway similar to the high osmolarity glycerol response 1 pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . (B) Ion channels that are opened in response to planar membrane tension or membrane bending could respond to both protoplast swelling or shrinking. The release of ions in response to hypoosmotic swelling would be similar to the MscS/MscL “osmotic release valve” paradigm in Escherichia coli . In addition, the entry of Ca 2+ through an opened MS ion channel could have downstream signaling properties. (C) Cell wall integrity-monitoring mechanisms could involve receptor-like kinases with extracellular domains capable of sensing the movement or disruption of cell wall components. The cell wall is presented as a gray box."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_008,"The plasma membrane is represented as a bilayer of gray lipid molecules. Plant water status is typically described in terms of “water potential,” a measure of the free energy status of water relative to pure water at a reference state. Water potential is derived from the chemical potential of water but is expressed in units of pressure, which makes it particularly useful in plant biology as a unified measure of soil and plant water status. Factors that decrease the free energy of water (such as increased concentration of dissolved solutes or adhesion to hydrophilic surfaces such as soil particles) make the water potential more negative, whereas factors that increase the free energy (such as increased turgor pressure) make the water potential more positive. Additional details of water potential can be found in Boyer and Kramer (1995) and Verslues et al. (2006) ."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_009,"The measurement of water potentials allows for simple predictions regarding the direction of water fluxes and changes in turgor ( Boyer and Kramer, 1995 ). Water potentials of 0 to −0.3 megapascals (MPa) are typical of well-watered plants, whereas water potentials of −1.5 to −2.0 MPa represent severe stress and permanent loss of turgor for many plants including most crop species and the model flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana . However, drought-adapted plants such as those found in deserts can grow at much lower water potentials, and both inter- and intra-species variation are emerging as important tools in understanding plant osmosensing mechanisms and adaptation to dry environments. The term “hyperosmotic stress” is infrequently used in plant biology."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_010,"This is because water limitation is rarely caused by the presence of high levels of extracellular solutes but is more often created by the unavailability of water (quantified as a decrease in water potential). The downstream effects of water limitation on plants that are commonly assayed include: the accumulation of compatible solutes such as proline, the induction of protective proteins such as dehydrins, the production of the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA), and increased sensitivity to ABA treatment in physiological assays ( Verslues and Juenger, 2011 ; Christmann et al., 2013 ). An illustration of the relevance of distinguishing between hyperosmotic stress and low water availability comes from simple treatments with extracellular solutions."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_011,"Treating plants with a solution of low molecular weight solutes such as NaCl will plasmolyze cells (a shrinking of the protoplast leading to its separation from the cell wall), whereas soil drying or treatment with large polymers that cannot penetrate the cell wall (such as PEG) will cause cytorrhysis (shrinking of both protoplast and cell wall). These two types of treatment elicit very different downstream responses and may in fact be perceived by different mechanisms. For example, root growth rate is much higher after cytorrhytic than plasmolytic treatments of the same MPa ( Verslues et al., 2006 )."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_012,"Furthermore, cytorrhysis and plasmolysis can have different effects on plasma membrane–cell wall connections (perhaps analogous to the effects of osmotic stress on focal adhesion complexes in mammalian cells; see below for further discussion), which in turn elicit different downstream signaling events. Plants experience water stress when the water content, and therefore the water potential, of the soil decreases. In addition, plants growing in hot dry air can become dehydrated, even when the soil is relatively wet, if water cannot be taken up rapidly enough by the roots to compensate for the water lost through stomata. Many plants regularly lose turgor during the day when the humidity of the environment is low relative to that inside the leaf, and stomates are open to support photosynthesis. They then rehydrate during the night when environmental humidity is high and stomates are closed."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_013,"In the laboratory, drought/water stress is imposed by withholding water from potted plants or by transferring plants to media with defined water potential ( Verslues et al., 2006 ). Hypoosmotic stress may occur transiently when dry soil is rapidly rewetted, and chronically upon repeated soil flooding. In the laboratory, hypoosmotic stress is typically reproduced by treating isolated cells with solutions of distilled water after equilibration in high levels of NaCl or mannitol. The phenomenon of water soaking, the accumulation of intercellular water during pathogenic invasion, promotes pathogen survival and may impose hypoosmotic stress on surrounding cells ( Beattie, 2011 ). In addition, some stages of plant development necessarily involve osmotic challenges, including the desiccation of seeds and pollen and their subsequent rehydration and resumption of metabolic activity."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_014,"It is also possible, though not yet demonstrated, that the cell wall weakening associated with cell expansion during normal plant growth may have some of the same effects as hypoosmotic stress. It is not fully known how plants initially sense any of the osmotic challenges described above. Three general models for osmosensing in plant cells are illustrated in Fig. 1 . Below, we further describe the molecular mechanisms thought to underlie each of these molecular models and summarize the supporting experimental evidence. In theory, a protein embedded in the plasma membrane could directly sense changes in osmolarity outside the cell, perhaps via an osmotically regulated conformational change in an extracellular domain ( Fig. 1 A ; Parsegian et al., 1995 )."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_015,"However, there is currently little experimental support for this model in any eukaryotic system (interested readers are directed to the accompanying discussion of prokaryotic osmosensors in the Perspective by Wood ). Several osmosensors involved in hyperosmotic signaling through the Saccharomyces cerevisiae high osmolarity glycerol response (HOG)1 pathway, including the histidine kinase Synthetic Lethal of N-end rule 1 (SLN1), were originally proposed to function in this manner, but recent data suggest that one or more of the other mechanisms listed below may instead be involved ( Saito and Posas, 2012 ). Plant homologues of SLN1 have been reported to serve as regulators of water stress responses ( Tran et al., 2007 ; Wohlbach et al., 2008 )."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_016,"However, other data have raised questions as to whether these kinases could be the main plant osmosensing system, as loss-of-function alleles have limited effects on key phenotypes such as the accumulation of ABA and osmoregulatory solutes ( Kumar et al., 2013 ). Alternatively, a novel calcium channel, REDUCED HYPEROSMOLARITY-INDUCED [Ca 2+ ] i INCREASE (OSCA)1, has recently been reported to be activated by hyperosmolarity and to be genetically required for several stress-related phenotypes ( Hou et al., 2014 ; Yuan et al., 2014 ); additional physiological experiments are needed to fully understand the role of OSCA1 and related channels in drought response. It is easy to imagine how hypoosmotic shock leads to increased plasma membrane tension; dehydration may have the same effect in plant cells because the plant plasma membrane and cell wall are physically linked at multiple locations."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_017,"Upon plasmolysis, most of the protoplast separates from the cell wall, but thin strands of plasma membrane (Hechtian strands) remain connected. As a result, both shrinking and swelling of the protoplast could increase plasma membrane tension. Mechanosensitive (MS) channels are capable of sensing membrane tension and responding to it by facilitating the flux of osmolytes across the membrane ( Fig. 1 B ). Multiple families of MS ion channels have been identified in plant genomes, and numerous MS ion channel activities have been detected in plant membranes ( Monshausen and Haswell, 2013 ). The MID1-COMPLEMENTING ACTIVITY (MCA) proteins, a family of putative MS ion channels, promote Ca 2+ influx in response to hypoosmotic shock and mechanical stimulus in several plant species ( Kurusu et al., 2013 )."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_018,"Although no defect in the response to hypoosmotic shock or water deficit has been reported in mca mutants, Arabidopsis MCA1 is required for a normal response to cell wall damage and for efficient root growth into a hard agar medium ( Hamann, 2012 ; Kurusu et al., 2013 ). Members of two other MS ion channel families, the MscS-Like (MSL) channels and the Two-Pore K + (TPK) channels, function in organelles (see below). An osmosensing function for plasma membrane–localized MSL or TPK channels has yet to be thoroughly investigated. The cell wall–plasma membrane interface is a critical site for detecting stimuli generated by changing water status. The Hechtian strands described above are reminiscent of focal adhesions of mammalian cells and, like focal adhesions, can be disrupted by treatment with peptides that harbor the amino acid motif RGD ( Canut et al., 1998 )."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_019,"This has led to the hypothesis that focal adhesion–like complexes may exist in plants and serve to sense alterations in plasma membrane–cell wall attachments caused by dehydration. Although direct orthologues of mammalian proteins such as integrins have not been found in plants, molecular modeling has uncovered an Arabidopsis protein with an integrin-like structure that may play a role in osmoregulation ( Knepper et al., 2011 ). Alternatively, plant osmosensing might bear similarities to cell wall monitoring mechanisms in yeast ( Hamann, 2012 ; Monshausen and Haswell, 2013 ). An osmosensor could bind directly to cell wall proteins, or mechanical change or cell wall damage could cause the release of specific molecules that are perceived by the osmosensor ( Fig. 1 C )."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_020,"More than 600 receptor-like kinases are encoded by the Arabidopsis genome, and it is thought that some of these have drought signaling functions ( Marshall et al., 2012 ). For example, THESEUS and FERONIA have lectin-like extracellular domains that may monitor cell wall status by binding directly to cell wall–derived carbohydrates or glycoproteins ( Cheung and Wu, 2011 ). Another family of receptor-like kinases implicated in cell wall integrity is the Wall-Associated Kinase family ( Kohorn and Kohorn, 2012 ). Genetic and biochemical studies support a model wherein Wall-Associated Kinases bind pectin, a component of the plant cell wall, and subsequently serve to control cell expansion through an unknown signal transduction pathway."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_021,"Vacuoles and plastids take up a substantial portion of plant cell volume, and the osmotic status of these compartments must be coordinated with that of the cytoplasm. Thus, the plasma membrane–based mechanisms described above are likely to be accompanied by an analogous osmosensing system in vacuolar and organellar membranes. However, little is known about these processes. The disruption of two plastid MSL channels constitutively activates low water potential responses, including ABA production and sensitivity, proline biosynthesis, and solute accumulation ( Wilson et al., 2014 ). Vacuole membrane–localized members of the TPK family were recently shown to be modulated by membrane tension and might serve a similar role ( Maathuis, 2011 )."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_022,"Thus, although MS channels have traditionally been associated with protection from extracellular hypoosmotic shock, they are also important in coordinating the osmotic status of intracellular compartments and have an as yet undefined connection to physiological mechanisms important to low water potential response. Downstream osmotic stress signaling pathways have received a great deal more attention than the initial perception of water deficit. Interestingly, stress-responsive solute accumulation in plant cells may share some mechanisms with solute accumulation in bacterial cells (see accompanying Perspective by Wood ). Other responses, such as the induction of protective proteins and stress-regulated gene expression, appear to involve plant-specific mechanisms, some of which depend on stress-induced increases in ABA levels ( Yoshida et al., 2014 )."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_023,"Many studies have characterized the extensive changes in intracellular calcium, transcriptional regulation, epigenetic modification, and posttranslational protein modification (especially phosphorylation) that occur in plants in response to hyperosmolarity, water limitation, and ABA ( Verslues and Juenger, 2011 ; Christmann et al., 2013 ). In addition, the molecular mechanisms of ABA perception are now known in detail ( Cutler et al., 2010 ). Although some of the genes induced or proteins modified in response to water limitation have clear roles in signaling, the synthesis or import of specific solutes and ions, or protection against reactive oxygen species, the functions of many other stress-induced genes are less clear."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_024,"A great deal of transcriptomic and proteomic data is being generated, but these data can be challenging to interpret because of the difficulty in distinguishing ABA-dependent signaling events from events that are directly related to osmosensing or mechanosensing. For example, several members of the SnRK2 family of plant-specific kinases are key players in ABA signaling and can be activated by exogenous ABA in the absence of osmotic stress. However, other SnRK2s cannot be activated by ABA but can still be rapidly activated by osmotic stress ( Boudsocq et al., 2007 ). How activation of these latter SnRK2s is connected to osmotic stress is not known."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_025,"Even the key downstream responses—ABA accumulation, the accumulation of protective solutes, and the induction of protective proteins—have not been definitively linked to signaling chains that lead all the way back to the initial perception of water limitation. Many of the mechanisms described above are also likely to be involved in hypoosmotic signaling, but more research is needed to establish the precise nature of the pathway and identify the critical components. Hypoosmotic stress administered to plant cells in suspension cultures elicits a rapid oxidative burst that depends on a phosphorylation cascade involving Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase and/or Calcium-Dependent Protein Kinase activation ( Cazale et al., 1999 ; Romeis et al., 2001 )."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_026,"The pathway is proposed to induce anion efflux, which is the driving force of osmoregulation in guard cells, but the molecular mechanism has not been determined. Despite our strong motivation to understand plant osmosensing and signaling, plant scientists still have a great deal of work to do. Key goals for future investigation include: (a) determining the molecular identity of the osmosensing apparatus, as detailed here and illustrated in Fig. 1 ; (b) characterizing the nature of the osmotic stress response signaling pathways upstream of the phytohormone ABA and distinguishing it from responses to other abiotic stresses; and (c) using a wider range of assays in genetic screens to include the full range of phenotypes relevant for plant adaptation to water-limited environments."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_027,"With regard to conclusively identifying plant osmosensors, the primary limitation at the moment is that no candidate osmosensors have been conclusively linked to stress signaling and key stress phenotypes. This bottleneck can be explained in part by redundancy; something as critical to plant life as monitoring and responding to water status probably involves multiple mechanisms. As described above, testing candidate genes that are homologues of known osmosensors in other systems is a start, but it will also be important to leverage the power of forward molecular genetic screens in Arabidopsis. For this to take place, phenotypic assays that are amenable to high throughput analysis and that either measure the primary stimulus of osmotic challenge or measure downstream responses directly regulated by osmosensors are needed."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_028,"A promising recent approach taken by several laboratories is to directly screen for altered calcium fluxes in response to osmotic stress (for example, Yuan et al., 2014 ). Natural variation and genome-wide association analysis also provide new and promising ways to find key genes that may be difficult to discover by classic forward or reverse genetic screens ( Verslues et al., 2014 ). In addition, new tools that would allow one to measure osmolyte movement, ion flux, membrane tension, or turgor in the proper cell biological context and in a noninvasive manner would likely be transformative for the field."
PMC4411250,PMC4411250_029,"Finally, the cytoskeleton is intricately involved in force sensing and controlling cell shape in mammalian cells (see accompanying Perspective by Sachs and Sivaselvan ) and is likely to have as-yet-undiscovered roles in the perception and signaling of osmotic stress in plants (in addition to controlling cell wall deposition and other properties). We anticipate that future work on all of these fronts from many laboratories will reveal the ways in which plant osmosensing is similar to osmosensing in other systems, and the ways in which it is unique to plants.

PMC5047659,PMC5047659_000,"The balance between proliferation and differentiation in the plant shoot apical meristem is controlled by regulatory loops involving the phytohormone cytokinin and stem cell identity genes. Concurrently, cellular differentiation in the developing shoot is coordinated with the environmental and developmental status of plastids within those cells. Here, we employ an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant exhibiting constitutive plastid osmotic stress to investigate the molecular and genetic pathways connecting plastid osmotic stress with cell differentiation at the shoot apex. msl2 msl3 mutants exhibit dramatically enlarged and deformed plastids in the shoot apical meristem, and develop a mass of callus tissue at the shoot apex."
PMC5047659,PMC5047659_001,"Callus production in this mutant requires the cytokinin receptor AHK2 and is characterized by increased cytokinin levels, downregulation of cytokinin signaling inhibitors ARR7 and ARR15, and induction of the stem cell identity gene WUSCHEL . Furthermore, plastid stress-induced apical callus production requires elevated plastidic reactive oxygen species, ABA biosynthesis, the retrograde signaling protein GUN1, and ABI4.

PMC5454470,PMC5454470_000,"Exposure to the microgravity conditions of spaceflight alleviates the load normally imposed by the Earth’s gravitational field on the inner ear utricular epithelia. Previous ultrastructural investigations have shown that spaceflight induces an increase in synapse density within hair cells of the rat utricle. However, the utricle exhibits broad physiological heterogeneity across different epithelial regions, and it is unknown whether capabilities for synaptic plasticity generalize to hair cells across its topography. To achieve systematic and broader sampling of the epithelium than was previously conducted, we used immunohistochemistry and volumetric image analyses to quantify synapse distributions across representative utricular regions in specimens from mice exposed to spaceflight (a 15-day mission of the space shuttle Discovery)."
PMC5454470,PMC5454470_001,"These measures were compared with similarly sampled Earth-bound controls. Following paraformaldehyde fixation and microdissection, immunohistochemistry was performed on intact specimens to label presynaptic ribbons (anti-CtBP2) and postsynaptic receptor complexes (anti-Shank1A). Synapses were identified as closely apposed pre- and postsynaptic puncta. Epithelia from horizontal semicircular canal cristae served as “within-specimen” controls, whereas utricles and cristae from Earth-bound cohorts served as experimental controls. We found that synapse densities decreased in the medial extrastriolae of microgravity specimens compared with experimental controls, whereas they were unchanged in the striolae and horizontal cristae from the two conditions."
PMC5454470,PMC5454470_002,"These data demonstrate that structural plasticity was topographically localized to the utricular region that encodes very low frequency and static changes in linear acceleration, and illuminates the remarkable capabilities of utricular hair cells for synaptic plasticity in adapting to novel gravitational environments. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Spaceflight imposes a radically different sensory environment from that in which the inner ear utricle normally operates. We investigated synaptic modifications in utricles from mice flown aboard a space shuttle mission. Structural synaptic plasticity was detected in the medial extrastriola, a region associated with encoding static head position, as decreased synapse density. These results are remarkably congruent with a recent report of decreased utricular function in astronauts immediately after returning from the International Space Station."
PMC5454470,PMC5454470_003,"sensory adaptation may be manifested as an alteration in the coding of natural stimuli subsequent to changes in the ambient sensory environment. For inner ear gravity receptors, the utricle and saccule, this environment is dominated by Earth gravity, which is constant over an organism’s lifetime, and chronic alterations in receptor loading are not known to exist. However, alterations in the gravity environment are experienced with spaceflight, and they can be implemented in the laboratory through chronic centrifugation. This raises questions concerning the capabilities of these sensory epithelia for adaptive modifications that may result from exposure to ambient gravitational field alterations, despite the absence of natural conditions in which such alterations may exist."
PMC5454470,PMC5454470_004,"Previous spaceflight studies have demonstrated that hair cells of the mammalian utricle exhibit the capability for synaptic plasticity ( Ross 1993 , 1994 , 2000 ; Ross and Varelas 2005 ). In these studies, which were based on analyses of serial transmission electron micrographs, it was reported that microgravity exposures of 9–13 days resulted in synaptic ribbon density increases within utricular hair cells. The greatest changes were found in specimens harvested in-flight (i.e., avoiding the gravity transitions associated with return to Earth gravity). Although increased synapse densities were found in both type I and II hair cells in flight-harvested specimens, analyses were not conducted from multiple loci across the topography of the utricle, and therefore it is not known whether parallel changes occurred in hair cells from different utricular regions."
PMC5454470,PMC5454470_005,"This is particularly important in view of the heterogeneity of response characteristics reflected by afferents projecting from different utricular regions ( Goldberg et al. 1990a , 1990b ). The significance of Ross’s findings is the demonstration that adult utricular hair cells can undergo synaptic modifications, despite the absence of any obvious conditions in which they would be naturally invoked. As noted above, it has yet to be determined whether hair cells in all regions of the utricle exhibit the capacity for synaptic plasticity. Resolution of this question will be informative of the underlying factors driving the synaptic modifications in view of the differential sensitivity to dynamic linear acceleration stimuli across the utricular topography."
PMC5454470,PMC5454470_006,"For example, afferents projecting from extrastriolar and striolar utricular regions exhibit heterogeneity in their dynamic response characteristics ( Eatock and Songer 2011 ), whereby the low-pass characteristics of extrastriolar afferents enable them to signal steady-state changes in head orientation relative to Earth gravity ( Fernández and Goldberg 1976a ; Goldberg et al. 1990b ). In contrast, steady-state stimuli are less effectively transmitted by striolar afferents ( Fernández and Goldberg 1976a ; Goldberg et al. 1990a , 1990b ) due to pre- and postsynaptic factors that include the expression of delayed rectifier potassium conductances in type I hair cells ( Rüsch et al. 1998 ) and low-voltage-activated potassium conductances in afferent calyces ( Lysakowski et al. 2011 ; Meredith and Rennie 2015 )."
PMC5454470,PMC5454470_007,"Consequently, a finding of structural plasticity confined to the extrastriola would be consistent with the preferential sensitivity to steady-state stimuli within this region and a reflection of potential afferent response modifications in the new gravitational environment. On the other hand, plasticity found in all regions of the utricle could also result from a variety of uncontrolled variables associated with the spaceflight environment that are not specifically related to gravity (e.g., radiation). In this report, we present our findings of synapse quantification from the utricles of mice that constituted a portion of the biological payload aboard the space shuttle Discovery on STS-131, which launched on April 5, 2010, and landed on April 20, 2010."
PMC5454470,PMC5454470_008,"We analyzed these specimens for structural synaptic plasticity by using immunohistochemical methods to identify closely apposed immunofluorescent puncta representing presynaptic ribbons and postsynaptic receptor complexes. These specimens were compared with those harvested from control mice that were maintained in habitat modules identical to those housing animals on the shuttle middeck, and for identical periods. Our goal was to produce a broad perspective of the utricle’s capabilities for synaptic plasticity through a topography-based sampling strategy."
PMC5515506,PMC5515506_000,"These results indicate that hMSCs respond to clinorotation by adopting more rounded, less-spread morphologies. The angular frequency-dependence suggests that a cell’s ability to sense the changing gravity vector is governed by the rate of perturbation. For migration studies, cells cultured in clinorotated chemotaxis chambers were generally less motile and exhibited retraction instead of migration."
